4,"I am seriously livid that I can’t view WPD on mobile.As morbid as it may sound it’s my second most visited sub..

People deal with the problems they face in life different ways. How you might respond to a challenge might be different from mine. How you might deal with depression might be different that mine.

I say that to say this. I lost my daughter on 10/28/2016. I reached out to people on multiple platforms for help. For advice. For a open ear. For arms to wrap around me. For someone to just fucking tell me it’s going to be ok. I’m not saying the WPD community doesn’t have some cunts in it but it also has some of the most passionate, down to earth, realistic human beings I’ve ever met. I’ve had more conversations about death and the reality of it on this sub than any other plat form I’ve tried using. I’ve had conversations last for days and weeks and have had people check in on me.

I had to live through the horror of feeling my daughter get cold in my arms.. that’s why I am here. To see that the life I’m currently living in, is something that we are all going to have to face.

There is a video on here, and most will know which one I am talking about, it’s the video where the brick comes through the truck window and although you can’t see what happened you hear the husband reacting to it for a solid minute or so. That video makes people cringe and some people say it’s harder to watch than the cartel videos. For me when I hear it, I cry every time. I watch it every time but I cry every time as well. I cry because it literally takes me back to the exact moment where my wife and I found out our daughter died. Those cries of pain and sorrow and helplessness are forever burned into my brain, but they are my wife’s cries that I hear when I watch that video.

Watching stuff like that makes me just understand that someone somewhere knows what I am going through and it comforts me ( in a sick way ) to know that someone else knows the exact pain I feel. I’d rather watch that video 50X then have another conversation of someone telling me that they don’t know how I feel but I’ll be ok, I just need to accept that God wanted a Angel. 

So now to find out that I can’t come to this site on mobile (99.9%+ mobile redditor here) I am devastated. This sub is literally where I go to escape the fact that my daughter is in a box in a Cairo cabinet in my bedroom.

Try to think of who would be most appropriate to tell you what newspapers you're allowed to read, what movies you can see, what food you can eat. Who do you nominate? To whom do you delegate the task of deciding what is right and wrong for _you_?

I think the administration is trying really hard to be that person, and I don't like that. We're all grownups; we can decide for ourselves what we do and don't want to see.

In these circumstances, Reddit administrators may apply a quarantine.

Fair enough.

11,"I get that certain content or opinions go beyond the confines of free speech. However, what I'm seeing now is that the personal opinions of the Reddit admins determine what subs get quarantined, and not some legal line in the law. Blatant racism is obviously unwanted. Anything that violates local laws, advocating for harm etc. is obviously unwanted.

The problem is that 'feelings' are now apparently also a qualifier. If a sub offends someone, it gets quarantined. Subs are getting quarantined and banned left and right based on nothing but some vocal majority being offended and not liking the opinion of that sub in general. Even if the content itself isn't illegal in any way, it's the sheer fact that someone doesn't agree that is enough to get a sub in trouble.

To name some examples, having different opinions on genders isn't illegal. Yet some subs that are critical of the whole LGBTA alphabet soup spectrum are being quarantined or even banned. Based on what, exactly? Some group of people feeling offended by it and demanding the admins take action against an alternative opinion on a subject?

TRP's quarantine is another example of this. Discussing the sexual mechanics between men and women isn't illegal. But because it touches on a controversial point of view that some people don't agree with it gets quarantined.

It's 2018 and there are entire movements out there that will get offended at just about anything. These are people who will get mad, offended, feel personally attacked and will demand that everything that does not fit their world view is censored and removed. But being offended does not make you right or even justified in feeling that way. I, for one, am deeply offended by horses. If I can get a couple of hundred people to proclaim their hate of horses along with me, will Reddit's admins quarantine /r/Horses? After all, you wouldn't want it

> accidentally viewed by those who do not knowingly wish to do so

Point is this, and this goes out to Reddit admins and all the special snowflakes complaining about things that offends them:

You can disagree with someone's opinion all day long. But the second you want to silence someone for having a different opinion than you, you are literally no different than the worst regimes and governments the world has known in history. If Reddit proclaims itself to be open and diverse, then censoring content based on the opinion of a vocal minority is the entirely wrong direction to go in.

18,"Your goal is to reduce traffic to something by obfuscating it. The [Streisand effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Streisand_effect) and the [Cobra effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobra_effect) suggest that this may not work. Either you fully ban something, or you treat it the same. Trying to pull off a clever middle-ground may bring more attention to the content you thought you were hiding. As a wise man once said, do or do not, there is no try.

You can't stop people from curating repositories of quarantined content. For example -- you want people to use upvotes/downvotes as a way to hide uninteresting or unimportant content, but they don't. Just look at the votes on this thread. The post has 62% upvotes indicating that people use the votes as an agree/disagree button. Oof. People will do what they do, with complete disregard for developer intentions. Our colleagues at Facebook know this all too well.

Another example -- DRM. Many studios are ditching DRM because it suffers from the Cobra effect. The stronger the DRM, the more people want to hack it. This could be no different. By treating controversial topics specially, you may inadvertently bring more attention to them, thereby defeating the purpose. 

I predict that this is the precursor to mass censorship on Reddit. There are only two stable states, and quarantining is not one of them. Either you full ban, or don't -- That's the decision you are choosing to defer until later. You'll eventually have to decide, you will not be able to avoid this decision.

Clearly not, otherwise you wouldn't require an e-mail validated account and desktop access to proceed to view such a community. You're not just asking people to say ""I accept this shit might fuck me up"", you're throwing hurdles in their way even when they want to view it. 

Now, if you *want* to bleed a subreddit dry by doing that it's your choice - you run the site, it is your decision. Just don't be disingenuous about it - this thread is full of people who see through you and who are becoming increasingly resentful of your attitude towards them. People may not like your decision but if you treat them with enough respect to be honest about it, they may very well return that respect to some degree.

25,"As part of an ongoing project involving Reddit, I've been cataloging some information about popular subreddits. I've compiled a list of around ~7,000 of the most popular, active and public subreddits, and collected some general API-related information about them.

As luck would have it, I tested the collection of this data this morning, and so I have a table of around ~7,000 rows of subreddit info. Prior to this post, I filtered that data by quarantine-status, just out of curiosity, [and it turns out that *none* of the subreddits I collected information for are quarantined](https://imgur.com/W0olPfI).

I wondered to myself what the point of the quarantine feature was, if literally no subreddits of the top 7,000 had been quarantined, since, to my knowledge, communities still just get banned/removed, as with before its existence.

I didn't have anyone to ask about that until.. 48 minutes ago. So uh.. I guess you guys are going to use this feature more, going forward?

I'd prefer Reddit not babysit at all and let adults decide for themselves what they want to see, but since that most likely won't happen, the next best approach for Reddit would be to quarantine blatantly toxic subreddits without slipping into an advisory or parental role, as this inevitably leads to subjective bais and proselytizing the company and admin ideology. If they try this approach, it will probably backfire. They must exercise a cautious hand.

With that said, there has to be some distinction between ideas that are uncomfortable (such as differing political and religious opinions) and ones that are hateful. This has been said a million times before. It's no secret that these are closely intertwined, sometimes nearly indistinguishable. Thank polarization and radicalization for that. As such, a system of checks and balances is very much needed.

So I take issue with this attitude. If something is so clearly factual, then why would there be the need to censor people that claim the opposite?

Censorship is probably the biggest form of oppression that will yield the opposite result of what you want every time. You're just giving people more reasons to believe they're right.    


> The purpose of quarantining a community is to prevent its content from being accidentally viewed by those who do not knowingly wish to do so, or viewed without appropriate context. We’ve also learned that quarantining a community may have a positive effect on the behavior of its subscribers by publicly signaling that there is a problem. This both forces subscribers to reconsider their behavior and incentivizes moderators to make changes.   

So you're basically putting them in the Gulag to have them ""learn from their mistakes"". Of course people will be more careful if they're being censored.

Here's what they found in short:

>In 2015, Reddit closed several subreddits—foremost among them r/fatpeoplehate and r/CoonTown—due to
violations of Reddit’s anti-harassment policy. However, the effectiveness of banning as a moderation approach
remains unclear: banning might diminish hateful behavior, or it may relocate such behavior to different parts
of the site. We study the ban of r/fatpeoplehate and r/CoonTown in terms of its effect on both participating
users and affected subreddits. Working from over 100M Reddit posts and comments, we generate hate speech
lexicons to examine variations in hate speech usage via causal inference methods. We find that the ban worked
for Reddit. More accounts than expected discontinued using the site; those that stayed drastically decreased
their hate speech usage—by at least 80%. Though many subreddits saw an influx of r/fatpeoplehate and
r/CoonTown “migrants,” those subreddits saw no significant changes in hate speech usage. In other words,
other subreddits did not inherit the problem.

John Naughton is professor of the public understanding of technology at the Open University. earlier this year he wrote a [clear opinion piece](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/18/extremism-pays-why-silicon-valley-not-shutting-it-down-youtube) on how you, reddit, as a social media site, profit off hosting extremism.

>The tech giants’ need for ‘engagement’ to keep revenues flowing means they are loath to stop driving viewers to ever-more unsavoury content

You're dressing up shit instead of banning it, even though you **know banning hate works**

He writes:

>Watching social media executives trying to square this circle is like watching worms squirming on the head of a pin. The latest hapless exhibit is YouTube’s chief executive, Susan Wojcicki, who went to the South by Southwest conference in Texas last week to outline measures intended to curb the spread of misinformation on her platform. This will be achieved, apparently, by showing – alongside conspiracy-theory videos, for example – “additional information cues, including a text box linking to third-party sources [about] widely accepted events, like the moon landing”. It seems that the source of these magical text boxes will be Wikipedia.

Reddit isn't doing even that. Reddit is guaranteeing echo chambers of junk content who in many cases **actively ban** dissent or dissenting voices. 

In public, reddit's top staff are calling this ""valuable conversation"" worth having.


----

In a [speech earlier this september](https://points.datasociety.net/media-manipulation-strategic-amplification-and-responsible-journalism-95f4d611f462) 

Danah Boyd says, very accutely:

>Over the last 25 years, the tech industry has held steadfast to its commitment to creating new pathways for people who historically have not had access to the tools of scaled communication. Yet, at this very moment, those who built these tools and imagined letting a thousand flowers bloom are stepping back and wondering: what hath we wrought? Like the ACLU and other staunch free speech advocates, we all recognized that we would need to accept a certain amount of ugly speech. But never in their wildest imaginations did the creators of major social media realize that their tools of amplification would be weaponized to radicalize people towards extremism, gaslight publics, or serve as vehicles of cruel harassment.

Reddit is quickly becoming the only major platform without rules against hate speech.

Reddit is becoming (if it isn't already) the platform where haters gather to hate, unobstructed by mods who insulate their views against counter-speech and examination.

**1)** Why is reddit not banning hate speech when it works?

**2)** Why is reddit allowing hateful echo chambers

Every developed country in the world has some form of law on the books against hate speech except the United States. There are tonnes of legally practiced, clear, objective definitions with decades of jurisprudence to take from.

**3)** Why isn't reddit's policy team taking hate speech seriously?

**4)** What are the 3 biggest reasons for quarantining rather than banning the shittiest communities you choose to host? What are the 3 biggest reasons reddit view **for** banning hate communities rather than quarantining them? What other options in between are you considering, like banning removal of comments for dissenting with the circlejerk?

Quarantined communities don't get ads. They're effectively subsidized by the rest of reddit. all of reddit is paying to host its worst communities.

Currently the quarantined subreddits do *not* work at all like the NSFW subreddits. And you know that.

In order for the quarantine work in any acceptable way for the users, it *needs* to have explicit and objective rules on what behaviour and/or content that gets your community quarantined. I am not seeing that - I'm seeing something completely subjective, arbitrary, and implicit.

So let me start off with standard and FAIR criticism that the COMMUNITY is the reason that Reddit is even a company or in business and that community was built by early commitments by Reddit to be a place of open discussion and discourse dedicated to free and ""legal"" (let's ignore that caveat for now) after wooing the Craigslist Rants and Raves emigrants after the Ebay had that platform shutdown along with other similar moves across the discussion space in the mid to late oughts.  What we are all starting to see is shades of that shit again (well not shades anymore) that all started when /u/spez took over as CEO whom I'm rather positive was installed in that position by the 2014 venture capital float on the condition he acts as their personnel hatchet man cue the recent war on people that insulted one of their intersex spouses. Now all that is legitimate and fair business practice BUT you are simply burning your community down on tactical battles undermining the long term viability of the business THOUGH once again maybe that is all intentional, i.e. maybe the majority shareholders want cash out and run and maybe /u/Spez secretly hopes so he can buy back into the company for less than he sold it; lots of founders to that though it never works for them outside a labor of love.  This recent shit is bad for Reddit and like it or hate it, it will benefit the competition which in the long run will hurt Reddit in the same way MySpace, Sun, IBM sowed the seeds of their own irrelevant.

So now lets get into the particulars:

> average redditors may nevertheless find highly offensive or upsetting

The problem here is the COMMUNITY DOESN'T TRUST YOU.  This is like when the SCOTUS rules on obscenity and holds a case even though the community norm long since quit holding that material obscene.   You are making an assertion which everybody understands is a lie and it would help your case if you openly released metrics on that, i.e. ""we use statistically sound impartial measuring techniques to determine the average Redditor and then randomly poll tens of thousands of them of them on specific subs to determine if in fact they find it offensive or upsetting and, if so, would agree it should be quarantined"".  You guys are basically pulling the ""OMFG THINK OF THE CHILDREN"" argument when we all damn well know children aren't that fragile or naive and are indifferent to whatever it is that is being banned in their name.

> not seriously up for debate (eg, the Holocaust did happen and the number of people who died is well documented). 

Well the first part of that is true; not washing ones after coming from the morgue before delivering a baby was also not up for serious debate and the inappropriateness of doing so was also verifiable; thank God Reddit didn't exist back then or the infant mortality rate would still be sky high.   Equally Reddit is starting to fall victim of goodspeak and appears to be a believer in the much discredited Sapir–Whorf hypothesis which I find amusing because under your own point here you would quarantine yourself given your believe in said hypothesis.

Reddit is sowing it's own seeds and it's sad to see that as a guy who has been on here for over a decade; hate when great platforms abandon what people fell in love with just to make quick buck or because their controllers change their mind.

?

The mainstream point of view is given by the Jewish Virtual Library here: https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/documenting-numbers-of-victims-of-the-holocaust It says:

>Calculating the numbers of individuals who were killed as the result of Nazi policies is a difficult task. There is no single wartime document created by Nazi officials that spells out how many people were killed in the Holocaust or World War II.

>To accurately estimate the extent of human losses, scholars, Jewish organizations, and governmental agencies since the 1940s have relied on a variety of different records, such as census reports, captured German and Axis archives, and postwar investigations, to compile these statistics. As more documents come to light or as scholars arrive at a more precise understanding of the Holocaust, estimates of human losses may change.

Is reddit as a whole now against the mainstream point of view? Why do you disagree with it so definitively?

309,"I'm honestly on the fence about Quarantining. Granted reddit is a company that cares about it's image, and it's a good excuse for something like /r/spacedicks which is something you definitely should not see unless you were looking for it, however since it's been quarantined, that sub has pretty much died, and I think just because someone (or even most people) disagrees with the content doesn't mean it should be smothered until it's gone. 

I still see Reddit as a free-speech website, a place where you used to be able to find anything and everything, and a place where the unpopular opinion could have a voice and sometimes even an intelligent discussion. I know T_D was basically a troll sub, which sucks because I can't tell anyone I'm a trump supporter without them genuinely thinking I'm a racist homophobe circle jerking moron (I have my reasons, but people are so passionately against the guy they won't even hear me out), and I get a lot of recent reddit censorship is trying to justify the reason they're bad and prevent future similar situations, but I think killing what made me fall in love with reddit is the wrong choice. 

Quarantining is a step in the right direction, sure, but with the death of spacedicks I'm not sure it is the right direction, yet. Reddit was a great outlet to find stuff you couldn't find anywhere else, and it's steered away from that. Sometimes I like to pop my head into the crazy and extreme simply to try and understand it and broaden my horizons. 

My only suggestion is to focus on brigading and other forms of sub bleeding (example, removing fatpeoplehate just caused it to flood everywhere else), but still allow these communities to exist in their own pocket where they can be easily found by curious or like minded people, so they don't die like spacedicks did.

310,"In light of all this, have you considered the effect of ""working the refs""? The idea that one side continually calls the referee unfair and biased, no matter what.

647,">there are some things that are either verifiable or falsifiable and not seriously up for debate

This is the key fallacy and danger of this entire way of thinking.

**Everything** must **always** be up for debate.

Doubt is the very bedrock of civilization. Everything we have achieved as a species has been driven by the realization that our understanding of the world is limited, our conceptions frequently flawed, and our achievements imperfect and never realized to their fullest potential.

The hallmark of an advanced culture is one that welcomes questions, not simply of the wider world but also through internalized examination of its own flaws, failings and inconsistencies. 

Even in the most precise fields of science we are constantly uncovering entirely new mechanics which shift our understanding of the very foundations of reality at the smallest and grandest scales imaginable.

Within the sociopolitical sphere 'truth' is far more malleable and has been shown countless times throughout history to be very easily distorted by governments who manifested a firm control of their bureaucracy and media, along with an utter disregard for these self same fundamental values of open discourse.

The suggestion that ""our government is better than that"" only rings true when strongly worded, passionate debate can be freely shared on any subject. In our current climate of increasing criminalization of 'Hate Speech', ideological and corporate policing of social networks, Sesame Scores, and political correctness, any further move toward restricted expression should rightfully be viewed as a dangerous infringement of civil liberties.

Certainly, as a private business Reddit is not beholden to the public good and has no ethical obligation to uphold what is best for society at large. However, in the same way, it should not be allowed to pass off censorship in service to its market value, as a moralistic crusade to protect us from ourselves.

Meanwhile due to what WAS (not possibly it definitely was) sheer gross incompetence you banned r/gundeals temporarily because you don't understand how seriously the ATF regulates us.

In fact r/incels is now known as r/braincels and much like T_D is utterly disgusting. Much like the failure of admins to address subreddits like 2X for abusing autoban bots (which if memory serves me right violates TOS). Then there's moderator abuse that has yet to be taken care of, such as the recent incident on r/roll20, or the fact that I cannot emphasize this enough; T_D is still here. 

They brigade, terrorize, promote murder, rape, send out death threats, and overall represent some of the most vile, disgusting, horrid, atrocious, evil, pointless, negligent, and cruel part of Reddit.

In fact forget everything else I said, because I can easily deal with every other bit of gross idiocy mentioned above if you would just get rid of T_D and be done with them.

I don't need Reddit telling me the sub I decided to follow isn't suited for me. If someone happens to come accross the sub for the first time, sure. Give them a warning. Else, leave us current subscribers alone.

Furthermore, the idea that a sub cannot be found through the search function is just bullshit. How are users supposed to find new subs, even if the content isn't suitable according Reddit staff?

Furthermore, if a sub does *not* violate the supposed content policy, then why should it be quarantined in the first place. It confirms to your rules. If people don't like it, then they don't have to view it. It the same concept as not liking coffee and therefore not drinking it.

What about these double standards? One sub gets quarantined, but another doesn't? Both make the same offences, but one is punished. Who decides what gets quarantined or not? This process it just picking a choosing, disregarding *your* own ""rules."" Just because you favor a sub more, doesn't mean you get to give it some special treatment.

It's also a big mistake to cut off gilding in such subs. For one, people aren't going to like that. Furthermore you don't just cut off an income stream.

I'd say more about this mess of a decision, but I feel that the community has voiced their opinions, as they should. Not that the Reddit staff will care.

I completely disagree with the suppression of information and agree that tagging it as NSFW and helping people understand that it is very graphic is enough to let individuals know what they're about to take a look at, if anything make it where subs with graphic content have a disclaimer like the warning but instead the description of the group is the first thing that they see a long with the warning that the content is graphic. This is excessive imo, and this whole thing about incentivizing, ""positive behavior"", especially this idea about what one could consider a positive effect on the community or the site as a whole is extremely objective.

938,"I know this is a 3 month old post, so I don't expect a reply, but why do you have to opt in subreddit by subreddit?  It seems like this is trying to accomplish something similar to googles safe search (at least in part).  So why couldn't a user opt in to quarantined subs site wide with a toggle?  It seems like a byproduct of this design will allow hostile communities to have a nice quite corner, which means long term it will create difficult to detect shadowy corners for shaddy activity.  I can see the site wide benefit of reducing the conflict between groups, but it comes at the cost of those groups being able to come to an understanding of eachother.  Which I assume would be a positive thing.  

One of the things I've like most about reddit is how open and interconnected it is, but this strategy seems like it will promote isolation and allow hostility to fester.  Which doesn't seem like a positive thing.  

I can appreciate the task you all face at reddit, but I think what is being missed here is that hate and bigotry (and fake news) are only one part of the problem.  Individuals and organizations abusing the platform to push agendas professionally is the otherside of it.  It's one thing to buy ad space, or have a sub dedicated to your party or views, that's open and transparent.  It's another thing to have individual users pumping content all day flooding the site.  

That's one of the biggest problems reddit has faced in the last two years.  There's been hostile garbage on reddit (and the internet, and in rl communities) since the beginning and there always will be.  They're a minority.  The issue that needs to be dealt with is solving the problem of manipulations that cause that garbage to be inflated, giving the individuals that ascribe to it a sense of empowerment, and giving the greater community a sense that it is more pervasive than it actually is.  

I'd recommend looking at atypical user behavior and their interactions with a community, rather than the content of that community.   There are strategies that people will employ to attempt to influence others or push an idea.  By looking for those I imagine you could pick out the bad apples without isolating whole subreddits.

945,"This post was pretty controversial. I think it's not as unclear as some make it out to be. They want to quarantine toxic subreddits, specifically those that are **dedicated** to things **like** racism, anti-Semitism, misogyny, etc. I think that's fairly clear. ""Dedicated"" and ""like"" being the operative words here. For those who asked about misandry and the like not being mentioned, I would have to assume those too will fall under this list. A specific list would be helpful, but it might he hard to make an exhaustive list. I'd go as far as to say that it can start with listing topics that are bigoted against a protected class in the US, though Reddit is international. Going further, this is about subs dedicated to these beliefs. This is why they don't ban subs that are not stated to be racist. Someone gave the example of asianbeauty vs whitebeauty. The former is about showing beauty care directed at Asian people and the latter is explicitly a white supremacist subreddit. A subreddit showing off pictures of only Caucasian people's beauty is not worthy of a ban. A subreddit showing Caucasian people's beauty AND promoting white supremacy is. I think there has been a ton of really terrible retorts against the admins. People's agendas cause logic to go out the window though, in my experience, many people are incapable of understanding logic. Some people keep saying that ""the right"" is being censored and that ""the left"" dominates Reddit. Not liking racism and white supremacy (and asian supremacy and black supremacy) and not liking misogyny (and misandry) and not liking bigotry and xenophobia and wanting people to be able to get help if they need it - these are not and should not be ""leftist agenda"" - it should be everyone's agenda. Why do we hear conservatives say that everything has a ""liberal bias""? Because it's really that everything has a ""not far right"" bias.

1079,"Hello reddit people. I don't think you should just have the power to quarantine people from being seen by others. I think you guys love exerting your power over users. For example you banning subreddits. Could you perhaps, un-ban some of the subs you have recently banned?  You defining what is or what is not 'bad for the community' is and censoring on a whim is a massive overstepping of bounds. The internet and supposedly reddit was popularized because people could share new ideas and exert their free speech. The founder of reddit, Aaron Swartz, died for this belief, and the fact that you have turned your back on him is frankly a shame. If nothing that a group does is explicitly illegal then why should you feel the need to censor the group? I understand why it could be bad for advertisers, but now that you have this quarantine ability, why not bring back the non-illegal subreddits. Specifically I am talking about /r/greatawakening. If the posts and posters their beliefs are are so *wrong*, then why not let them post and let people see how wrong they are? If the posts are so harmful, then surely quarantining them is enough. I am concerned about how reddit mods, a completely unelected group of people, can censor people on a whim with no appeal.

It absolutely will. And as someone who very much believes in sunlight and engagement as the best disinfectant, I don't think it helps the problem so much as hides it.

*However*

Reddit has actually made me start to question whether it's worth it. People just..arent very good at thinking past their emotions. It takes an *enormous* amount of work to pull someone out of the muck, and they are generally clawing and scratching you the whole way. Add a community aspect where they get high fives for doing so, and it looks like less and less attractive work.

I'm realizing that, at least for me personally, I'm not sure that I actually care about the rest of you enough to continually subject myself to that. In that spirit, I understand the idea of quarantine. 

I hate that it is essentially giving up. But I'm not sure I'm willing to devote hours of my life to trying to pull someone's head out of their own ass with long, thought out posts and discussion when they'll just downvote it, laugh, and think themselves clever for doing so. 

Edit: [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/announcements/comments/9jf8nh/revamping_the_quarantine_function/e6r4w73/?context=3) is a solid example of what I mean in this very thread.

It's not about reducing traffic, it's about preventing people from accidentally stumbling on the subreddit and seeing content that the average person wouldn't want to see and trying to spur the mods/posters to make change to get farther away from the ban threshold. It's not a denial of service to the user like DRM, it's just a warning to them. It doesn't matter if more attention is drawn the the subreddit, or if users curate lists of the content, the staff just doesn't want to make an official list because that's the equivalent of a ""Sort by Offensiveness"".

1342,">Your goal is to reduce traffic to something by obfuscating it. The Streisand effect and the Cobra effect suggest that this may not work. Either you fully ban something, or you treat it the same. Trying to pull off a clever middle-ground may bring more attention to the content you thought you were hiding. As a wise man once said, do or do not, there is no try.

I have to disagree with this.  The Cobra effect isn't relevant here; its a description of an accidental outcome, not a process by which it might occur.  The Streisand effect is a process, but it might not apply in this situation.  

The Streisand effect works precisely because it makes something unique and thus interesting.  However, if the quarantine covers enough different content, no single topic will be unique enough for the Streisand effect to have a major effect.  Its a form of reactance, and if the reactance can't latch onto a specific target (like a specific sub getting attacked), the reactance will be to the quarantine itself, not to the content getting quarantined.  Basically the effect will be to popularize the existence of the quarantine, but specific subs within the quarantine may still be ignored.

The Streisand effect works by making something stand out.  By hitting a bunch of targets at once, nothing stands out.  Later additions to the quarantine might grab more attention; they'd have to hit a bunch at once to minimize the blowback.

None of this is to say I agree with this action, but I think it might actually be successful to achieve the goals they want.",0,e6t3wkk,i_miss_arrow,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7f8df2ec9350>,t1_e6sbppi,1538155965

Because the left is losing the culture war. They were convinced that they're on the right side of history but when it turned out wrong they started to suffer from mass shock and psychosis.

When reality turned out to have an alt-right bias, Silicon Valley went apeshit and started banning, rigging, throttling and artificially promoting content to give the impression that history is still going in their direction.

Not which are applicable or transferrable to US jurisprudence. They don't have a common law basis and none of those countries respect the aforementioned right to free speech. 

>Why is reddit allowing hateful echo chambers

Because what you think is a hateful echo chamber is different from what I think is one. There is no objective standard and if Reddit goes around banning communities because they're trying to censor certain viewpoints then they potentially open themselves up to litigation or regulation if someone is able to establish that they're acting as publishers and not as a platform. 

Quarantining is the correct *business* decision as it limits Reddit's exposure to liability from users, advertisers and/or regulators. ",4,e6s35wz,MallNinja45,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7f8df3bab510>,t1_e6qz5se,1538109701

1725,"> I think all censorship should be deplored. My position is that bits are not a bug – that we should create communications technologies that allow people to send whatever they like to each other. And when people put their thumbs on the scale and try to say what can and can’t be sent, we should fight back – both politically through protest and technologically through software

> Both the government and private companies can censor stuff. But private companies are a little bit scarier. They have no constitution to answer to. They’re not elected. They have no constituents or voters. All of the protections we’ve built up to protect against government tyranny don’t exist for corporate tyranny.

> Is the internet going to stay free? Are private companies going to censor [the] websites I visit, or charge more to visit certain websites? Is the government going to force us to not visit certain websites? **And when I visit these websites, are they going to constrain what I can say, to only let me say certain types of things, or steer me to certain types of pages?** All of those are battles that we’ve won so far, and we’ve been very lucky to win them. But we could quite easily lose, so we need to stay vigilant.

Edit: Every teenager likes to scream “Orwell!” at the mention of censorship, like most of you idiots replying to me, but that is only a small part of the book. 

Anyone can control information, but they didn’t just censor information, they completely rewrote history.  **Censorship was one tool of many they used to achieve their goal.** They also used fear and brutality. They turned people into spies against each other so you couldn’t know ho to trust. They used mass surveillance. They used torture. They used propaganda. 

Saying 1984 is about censorship misses the real message. What they were able to do is make people genuinely believe things they knew to be false. ""We have always been at war with Eastasia."" You remember that? That was the real power the government held. That is what the book was about. 

And that's what were seeing now with Trump ad Fox News and talk radio. The right in this country will disregard things they absolutely 100% know for a fact to be true, all because the President or Sean Hannity tells them it's false. Just look at any press conference given by Sarah Sanders. Hell it started the day Trump took office with his lies about his inauguration crowd size. People on the right, to this day, will tell you that Trump had the largest crowd to ever attend an inauguration. And that is just one of hundreds of examples.

I really don't care what people laugh to or what opinions they hold, but acting like everyone who disagrees with you slightly are offensive or plain wrong is just childish and unproductive.

I remember that in my school there was this class where they thought how to act in the real world. The first lesson was about disagreements. Attacking people for different opinions does not get you far in life, and actually is huge reason for most of the higher-level employees of big name companies are forced to leave.

I think that was at 3rd grade.

Do you remember when that was taught to you?

Yeah, it's important to remember these things. Acting like a deranged child and attacking anyone who slightly disagrees with you, makes fun of you or parodies something is not mature or effective. If you disagree with them, don't attack their comedians. That's a slow sweep towards a pole.

1826," propaganda (prŏpˌə-gănˈdə)►

n.

    The systematic propagation of a doctrine or cause or of information reflecting the views and interests of those advocating such a doctrine or cause.

n.

    Material disseminated by the advocates or opponents of a doctrine or cause: wartime propaganda.


What is wrong with this? Should anything that tries to change someone's view be banned?

I don't understand you borderline-fascists. What is wrong with discussion and differing opinions? Propaganda is looked down upon for a good reason, but most times it is used to show off a problem, statistic or a fact. Propaganda does not mean ""everything factually incorrect"". Some propaganda shows a problem in a policy, like the Article 13 propaganda memes. Some lie, of course, but some don't.

So when is propaganda wrong? When it tries to change someone's view? Or is the view that it tries to change the problem?

Is the problem that it goes against you?

Propaganda is not always a bad thing. The hatred of propaganda comes from usage of propaganda in intellectual papers or journalistic work, where they should not belong. But in open forum? What opinions and arguments are allowed? Those that are not good enough to be able to change anyone's mind?

#**WHAT THE FUCK**

/u/spez, /u/landoflobsters anybody at reddit, I think we deserve an explanation why you are explicitly endorsing an extreme misandrist like Michael Kimmel. 

For anybody who is unaware of who Dr. Kimmel is, he runs the Stony Brook University's Center for the Study of Men and Masculinities. He goes way beyond the normal examples of feminism that people criticize. He is possibly the most influential misandrist alive. NOMAS, the organization that he founded and leads, claims that [men are not victims of domestic violence or abuse.](https://archive.fo/PwtXC). When MRAs sued California (**and won**) for denying equal rights to male victims of DV, it was Kimmel and NOMAS who protested and fought (**and lost**) for the right of California to continue denying help to male victims of abuse. Kimmel and NOMAS also believe that fathers should not seek custody after divorce, because children are best served by having their father be nothing but a breadwinner. He says that International Men's Day is the same as White History Month. Kimmel has made a career out of insisting that only men are sexist, never women. In [The Red Pill documentary](http://theredpillmovie.com/) (unrelated to /r/theredpill, it's a documentary by a feminist investigating the Men's Rights Movement), Kimmel represents the feminist views claiming that there is no need for any movement to address men's issues because men have all of the privilege and only women have any issues. This is apparently what reddit believes.

The Stony Brook Study of Men and Masculinities is NOT a Men's Studies department. Kimmel has always said that we don't need Men's Studies courses like Women's Studies, because ""every course is men's studies."" His center is about how men are terrible and how we can end our misogyny. It is not ""positive masculinity"" to tell men that we're all too privileged to have any problems and that we can't be victims of abuse or rape. It is not ""positive masculinity"" to say that only men can be sexist or enforce gender roles. It is misandry.

As a male victim of domestic violence who first joined the Men's Rights Movement after leaving an abusive relationship I am absolutely appalled by the decision of reddit admins to endorse a version of feminism that tells men that we can't be abused, and which tells male victims of domestic violence that we must have done something to deserve it. If you want to say ""not all feminists,"" we don't need to debate that now. FWIW I've met feminists who disavow Michael Kimmel. This isn't about whether all feminists or even most feminists support these horrible views, it's about Dr. Michael Kimmel who is a slimy, disgusting misandrist who is completely indefensible. And regardless of what other feminists do or don't believe, Kimmels misandry is the type of feminism that is being endorsed by the reddit admins right now.

There's always been discussion of where the admins stand on gender issues. /r/ShitRedditSays was founded by a former admin. Ellen Pao went on to moderate /r/negareddit, a sub similar to SRS. There was the admin who accused moderators of ""mansplaining."" They made /r/TwoXChromosomes a default. But **THIS**??? This is far too much. Reddit needs to explain themselves. Banning a misogynistic subreddit is not something I'll be upset about, but redirecting people to an extreme misandrist who says that male victims of DV don't exist and don't deserve support? This is not acceptable.

Your increasing tendency to ban communities and the heavy handed moderation that most communities are subjected to is more than enough.

If the goal is only to reduce exposure for those who wish to avoid it, those who don't care for your censorship should have the option to bypass it entirely.

That means no warning interstitial, no unexpected filtering of ""all""

They have no constituents or voters. All of the protections we’ve built up to protect against government tyranny don’t exist for corporate tyranny.

Like this: [https://www.reddit.com/api/info.json?id=t5\_2fwo](https://www.reddit.com/api/info.json?id=t5_2fwo)

I compiled a list of subreddits (and those IDs) by using the (amazing) resource of comment/post data scraped from Reddit monthly by  u/Stuck_In_the_Matrix and maintained by u/fhoffa, on Bigquery. (I think credit appropriately given where due, there.)

After collecting a table of valid subreddits from that corpus of comments, I basically just grabbed 731 listings worth of information about those 7,312 subreddits, 100 at a time, and filled in the blanks for the fields of information I know the API returns about each subreddit, including the quarantine field.

Now, there might actually be some collecting bias in the scraping that doesn't include quarantined communities, but I don't think there is.

People deal with the problems they face in life different ways. How you might respond to a challenge might be different from mine. How you might deal with depression might be different that mine.

I say that to say this. I lost my daughter on 10/28/2016. I reached out to people on multiple platforms for help. For advice. For a open ear. For arms to wrap around me. For someone to just fucking tell me it’s going to be ok. I’m not saying the WPD community doesn’t have some cunts in it but it also has some of the most passionate, down to earth, realistic human beings I’ve ever met. I’ve had more conversations about death and the reality of it on this sub than any other plat form I’ve tried using. I’ve had conversations last for days and weeks and have had people check in on me.

I had to live through the horror of feeling my daughter get cold in my arms.. that’s why I am here. To see that the life I’m currently living in, is something that we are all going to have to face.

There is a video on here, and most will know which one I am talking about, it’s the video where the brick comes through the truck window and although you can’t see what happened you hear the husband reacting to it for a solid minute or so. That video makes people cringe and some people say it’s harder to watch than the cartel videos. For me when I hear it, I cry every time. I watch it every time but I cry every time as well. I cry because it literally takes me back to the exact moment where my wife and I found out our daughter died. Those cries of pain and sorrow and helplessness are forever burned into my brain, but they are my wife’s cries that I hear when I watch that video.

Watching stuff like that makes me just understand that someone somewhere knows what I am going through and it comforts me ( in a sick way ) to know that someone else knows the exact pain I feel. I’d rather watch that video 50X then have another conversation of someone telling me that they don’t know how I feel but I’ll be ok, I just need to accept that God wanted a Angel. 

So now to find out that I can’t come to this site on mobile (99.9%+ mobile redditor here) I am devastated. This sub is literally where I go to escape the fact that my daughter is in a box in a Cairo cabinet in my bedroom.

Yes, Russia has been active on reddit as a whole and more successful than other areas on TD. But that doesn't mean all that's posted there is Russian propaganda. People like Trump. He got elected - the people fucking like the guy even you you personally don't.

You can't ban TD because sometimes they upvote Russian propaganda or else you have to ban politics for pushing the content that companies hired by liberals are putting out. You have to ban worldnews because Israel is pushing their naritive. Hell, I'm 100% sure the United States has some form of agency or is contracted with someone to push out the propaganda they want us seeing. 

There are people posting all over the site influenceing opinions and those organizations do a good job and it makes it to the top. It isn't a TD problem.

And while we're on the subject it needs to be said - just because you don't like it doesn't make it propaganda. The left wing, liberal ideological lense some of you view the world through is not the only valid view point. You call it propaganda and I call it my point of view and it is just as valid as yours.

 We all know the answer to this. It would not last a day. Yet, there is a double standard in play here that has been ongoing for so long it's beyond the status of an anomaly by any definition. 

When people threaten to hang, lynch, murder, rape or otherwise harm actual people, every other subreddit is expected to get on that shit immediately.

But most frightening - **radicalizing vulnerable kids who just need to feel they belong to something.** This is something Reddit is directly responsible for in my opinion.

Make no mistake, I understand and even, to some extent, support when certain subs are quarantined, for example r/wpd. As long as users like me can still access them, as long as there is no blatant censorship. I also don't want to people ""accidentally"" would come across a gore or similar sub.Check.

However, I think your reply here is dishonest. This is strange since further above you actually said exactly the reason why they're quarantined, it's for protecting your ad revenue, and that advertisers won't jump off. MOSTLY. (This is not even meant sarcastically. It is simply what it is, since websites need to generate revenue. I am not naive.)

But when I read you saying ""we want healthy communities"" I cringe. Because if it wasn't for advertisers, you know there would be no reason to ""quarantine"" a sub whatsoever. There would be no reason to quarantine a sub ""for healthy communities"", respective the absence of a quarantine, say as previously (again I am giving /wpd as an example) did in no way make the sub ""unhealthy"", now for USERS and the community.

The same with your (to me) strange mentioning of ""positive behaviour"", which somehow implies to me that a quarantine is some sort of punishment for a ""badly behaving sub"", whatever this may mean. Worse, you may even imply bad behaviour on the side of users, ie. people who would visit such subs would not ""behave positively""?! Is this really what you are implying there?

Again let me give watchpeopledie as an example. Do you think the sub is not ""behaving positively""...or that the fact that the sub shows deaths is something ""not positive"", simply due to what the sub is about, which IMO is fully legitimate in its own right, but of course ""not for everyone"". However, there is no ill-fated intention or any ""bad behaviour"", now from how I see it.

Gun Deals never assisted in illegal firearms purchases or transfers. Gun Deals was nothing more than a *coupon* site that raised awareness of deals offered through legitimate and legal sites.

Despite your wishes, purchasing a firearm and firearm accessories is still legal in the United States.

Instead of accusing me of lying, perhaps you should do some research before you start an emotional attack on someone just because you don't agree with their political views.

Please, tell me how your government is more democratic than mine, I'm from the Netherlands, but I would also be fine with a comparison to any Western European government. 

If you are talking about undemocratic hate speech laws, my country has a few, but they have not really been used except for the trials against Geert Wilders. While I am no supporter of Wilders, I do not like these trials at all. It does, however, not make my country undemocratic or even anything close to that. In fact, we have more press freedom than the USA (Ranking 3rd, the USA ranking 45th [link](https://rsf.org/en/ranking)), and are ranked higher in the Human Freedom Index (9th, USA 17th [Link](https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/human-freedom-index-files/2017-human-freedom-index-2.pdf)), as well as the US-made Freedom in the World survey ([link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_in_the_World#Country_rankings)), where my country still gets the highest score while the US fell a little below since last year. Yeah, you have guns, great. I can vote for someone that doesn't work for some big company, and actually make sure I won't need them.

In addition to all these things, the US has a serious corruption problem in both politics and the media. Yes, newspapers and television are sometimes a bit tilted to one side of the spectrum here as well, but nowhere near the amount it is in the US. Our political system is also not perfect, but at least with multiple parties the parties are inclined to collaborate instead of just throwing mud. It is absolutely horrendous that you have been brainwashed in such a way that you think your country is the only free country in the world, while it is being consumed from the inside by corruption. I fear the same might happen at some point here as well, but for now, you are the one in the sinking ship.

I think the number usually used is rounded to the nearest million.  The numbers do no sound all that thoroughly documented to me.

But I have little belief that 6 million is particularly accurate.

Trump can't even take a shit without the world judging it, which is perfect for accountability. 

Second, he's cockblocked by the Senate for every stupid idea he has, I was never afraid of him screwing up the county because of that (and because the losing side of each election loves to freak out and overreact. I heard the exact same shit from the right about Obama that I'm hearing from the left about Trump, and i didn't believe it then either). Only his actually sane and good ideas and plans get through, and the guy isn't 100% a moron as the media paints him out to be.

I mean, he's definitely arrogant, narcissistic, weak minded, and generally a bad person, but when the media hates someone they are vilified, and that's all people see and think of him. He isn't actually that bad, no one is. Look at all the actual good things he's done that no one talks about because negativity warps human brains. He's fought for gay rights, scared North Korea into brokering peace, put fake news on everyone's minds shaking the misplaced trust into the media (for better or worse for him), and has gotten more people to be interested in politics (god help us people do research beyond headlines, however.)

I approve of his immigration,stance, which is a controversial belief so I don't lump that in with the rest, and there is a strong possibility his economic actions might end up helping more than they hurt. Right now the US has no free health care and an overworked populous, while everyone else enjoys great living conditions because they rely on the US defending them. While I think pissing off allies and killing trade is a bad idea, if it ends up making the US independent enough to stand on its own again and benefit from trade instead of rely on it, we might actually become a decent county again.

3108,"Generally speaking, people as a collective, as is the case with pretty much any other social phenomenon. Like, your argument could apply to pretty much any aspect of content. E.g., “Anyone can laugh at anything, who decides what is ‘funny’?” “Anyone can be turned on by anything, who decides what is ‘attractive’?” etc. In fact, with some tweaking, it can be used with pretty much all language—“Anyone can call anything a ‘dog,’ who decides what a ‘dog’ is?” What you’re asking is actually something of a fundamental question in semiotics, and could be rephrased something like, “given the endless number of different ways different people can use the same sign, how can we meaningfully talk about what they refer to?” 

The basic answer a semiotician might give you would be that although any word could be used by a specific individual for any referent, communities of language users are essentially forced, by the pragmatic requirements of communication, to use any given word in such a way that there will be a fairly consistent resemblance between its referents where there is similarity in the context in which it is used. That is, meaning is determined by use in a bottom-up social process. 

This is simplifying things almost to the point of being misleading, but hopefully it gets the idea across of how we form a basis for talking meaningfully about what is ‘funny’ or ‘attractive’ or ‘a dog’ or ‘offensive,’.

Charge more for certain sites? No. Censor? No. Is the government doing this? No. Out of all of those questions, only one actually MIGHT apply... the one about steering us to certain pages. 

But a content warning is not steering views, any more than the “you must be 18 to view this” warning have ever steered any teenager away from porn. ",64,e6s75ma,AssaultedCracker,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7f8df3caa610>,t1_e6r3t6j,1538115519
3312,"Sure, I agree with that principle. Free speech is absolutely necessary to a functioning democracy.

But: here's the rub. Is there really free speech on The_Donald? Or the Q subs and the racist subs that this reddit policy is clearly aimed at? Nope. Anyone who's paying attention knows that those subs are absolute echo chambers. The second you post something that criticizes the established meta-narrative in those subs, you don't just get downvoted to oblivion, you get *banned*, instantly. Because I'm critical of the ideology espoused there, I don't have free speech rights on T_D (or most other far-right subs, and even some far-left subs). And the reddit admins aren't to blame- the moderation of the subs is at fault.

These subreddits are *not* the bastions of free speech you seem to imply they are, and the national discourse that free speech rights exist to protect will not be harmed by reddit admins taking a heavier hand with these echo-chambers.

3316,"This is a clever bit of sleight-of-hand here, either by you or by Swartz himself, depending on the context in which he said this. Because what's under discussion here is not whether private companies are going to censor the websites anyone visits, but whether a private company is going to decide what to allow on its *own* website.

But even if we engage your argument, and Swartz's argument, on the merits as if it applies entirely to the question at hand, I think we have to interrogate the free-speech absolutism that the argument displays. There is an assumption in Western society that free speech, in the abstract, is a virtue unto itself and must therefore be protected at all costs. But of course that's a subjective point of view, as is every position about what is a virtue and what is not.

Before we evaluate the value of free speech, we must establish first principles of the discussion. By what metric do we measure whether or not a thing is a virtue? To me, we measure it by whether or not, and to what degree, it promotes a society of people with a basically decent standard of living, with relative security in their livelihoods and living situations, who have a meaningful say in the course that society takes both socially and politically, and who live without a great deal of fear for their safety and lives.

Free-speech absolutism does not promote such a society. In fact, it promotes the opposite. If we do not allow ourselves to respond with opprobrium to outright lies, to hoaxes, to misinformation and disinformation, and particularly to those individuals and groups and entities that demonstrate a pattern of expressing those things, we grant falsehood equal standing with truth. If we do not, as a society, invest in some level of gatekeeping in this respect, we *will* become a society with a great number of people who are almost entirely divorced from the truth. These, therefore, are not people with a meaningful say in the course that society takes; you cannot effectively drive a car toward a desired destination if you do not know where you are. People working from a false foundation necessarily cannot contribute to moving society toward outcomes they wish to see. And the greater this number becomes, the more its tainted votes dilute and counterbalance the votes of those who *are* informed. Ultimately, everyone except those with a vested interest in promoting falsehoods loses the ability to participate meaningfully in the deciding of the course society takes.

But who has such a vested interest? It's not the Macedonian teenagers making a few G's off of fake news websites. It's the power elite. When the people's anger is directed at phantoms and shadows, it will never be directed at them. If half the country believes that there is an immediate existential threat to their way of life and it's coming from Arabs and Mexicans, they will of course be much less likely to ask themselves how the concept of private health insurance makes any Goddamn sense. If half the country believes that Hillary Clinton ran a child-sex dungeon, they will probably not have the time or emotional energy to invest in discovering the arbitrary and capricious methods by which health care providers set the prices for medical services.

I can't say why those with a great deal of material wealth want to continue to accumulate more of it. It seems to me that one would run out of things to do with money after the first 20 or 30 million dollars. But they definitely want more of it, and they definitely don't want to give up any of the money that they have. So their interests--which, again, are the only interests served by free-speech absolutism--are in direct opposition to the metric by which I, and I suspect many other people, would define whether something is a virtue. When the wealthy get wealthier, everyone else's living standards decline or stagnate. Job security and housing security plummet. Almost everyone's voice in the social, cultural, and political movement of society is diluted to the point of being meaningless. And such a climate necessarily breeds insecurity of a darker, more violent kind. Terrorism. Gang violence. Family abuse. Mass shootings.

Our society is sick. It's sick in ways that are new. I would not say that the United States, or the West in general, or the human race in general, was ever an unadulterated ""good"" in the world. Any honest survey of our history will put the lie to that. But we are sick in a way that is novel. Nobody believes in anything anymore. Nothing can be trusted. The walls are closing in on everyone. The President of the United States, unstable and unhinged as he may be, is the most powerful human being in the world and yet is convinced that he's the target of some nefarious shadow-government plot to destroy him. Our institutions are crumbling, and even though nearly all of them deserve some of the recent animus that's been directed at them, we also need nearly all of them to survive, because we have no backups.

And that world, that sickness, was built in large part by free-speech absolutism. It was contributed to in meaningful and significant ways by a belief that every voice, no matter how facially wrong and stupid and unjustifiable it was, deserved equal time and equal prominence. And so now here we are, living in a time when ""you can't trust the experts"" is a thing people say with a straight face. Here we are, in the most technologically advanced society that has ever existed, utilizing inventions that would have seem fantastical just 20 years ago and were only made possible by science, yet the political movement with the greatest degree of control over the world's only superpower is the one that rejects the scientific consensus on multiple topics of grave importance. People argue, *on the internet*, a modern scientific marvel, that scientific experts are bought and paid for and can't be trusted. People who are only alive because of modern medicine declare that modern medicine is a hoax.

At some point, it must become acceptable for us to say that certain people, certain groups, certain entities have proven to us that they cannot be trusted to use their freedom of speech in a responsible way. We must be able to place that which is toxic and has no socially redeeming value outside the bounds of what is acceptable. I don't know if we have to do that in a way that involves the law, but we must have some way of doing it.",21,e6rpub1,John-Zero,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7f8df3cc95d0>,t1_e6r3t6j,1538096222

If anything, the most akin to DRM a subreddit can be is if it has a gold-only requirement since it *does* deny user access without ""paying"" for it. 

Sure, they already acknowledged in this thread that they fully expect some users out there to make lists (they already exist), they just don't want to publicly list all of their ""most offensive"" content. It's essentially the equivalent of making a list of shock videos, why would they curate such a list to begin with? It's not censorship to not make a convenience list, it would be if they deleted posts containing such a list.

I've watched / catalogued the shenanigans of T_D since its inception. The admins did, at one point, swap out the entire (or nearly the entire) moderation team of the subreddit, when they were directing their subscribers to go out and harass / terrify users on the site.

That was during a period when the people on the T_D moderation team were *almost certainly* employees of Breitbart / Stephen Bannon / the Mercers, and one of the (obvious to me, anyways) goals of that group was to bait some social media into shutting down some forum dedicated to a politician, so that could be used for propaganda purposes  (""REDE VERBOT!"") -- or be used as pretext for a lawsuit that would result in case law that would remove control from user-content-hosting ISPs to address the content posted to their sites *at all* without a court order.

Reddit's admins were in a no-win Catch-22 situation as regards T_D before the election, and I believe (without reservation) that had Hillary Clinton won the Presidency, T_D would have been shut down within weeks, or at least would have wound up quarantined due to the actions of its users (while law enforcement used it).

But 

Reddit, like all other corporations operating in the United States, are required to comply with court orders, including court orders issued pursuant to law enforcement investigations, and are required to comply with National Security Letters. 

Moreover, they cannot publicly discuss or disclose these if they're sealed (or if they're NSLs).

They *can* give us *really flimsy justifications* that *technically hold up to a court's examination*, for the actions they are forced to take to remain in compliance with these orders, though -- which is about the only thing someone under a sealed subpoena or NSL, *can* do.

# Reddit, Inc.'s hands are tied.

This *is* a massive failure at the policy level.

It's not a massive failure at the Reddit policy level.

It's a massive failure at the level of America's public discourse.

It's time to reject the [Begala / Tucker Carlson / CNN's *Crossfire* / Fox ""News""] model of public civic discourse that allowed all of this to gain oxygen. 

It's time that we develop and popularise *actual standards of what counts as real discussion* and reject conflict-driven Circus spectacles.",90,e6r2iij,Bardfinn,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7f8df3deee90>,t1_e6qzfdr,1538076318

But at least be honest about the reasons that you want it to be shut down. You don’t want it removed because it’s a hate group; the amount of seething vitriol and hatred coming from the average user on default politics subs is absolutely disturbing. Do you care about that?

I am a libertarian/classic liberal. I have been told to impale myself, hang myself, told not to vote, that I should be wiped off the planet, etc. *just because of my political opinion*. I have been banned from most default news subs for trolling with no explanation, just from dissent. I have never “trolled”. Of all the disgusting remarks I’ve ever received on this site, **not a single one occurred in the_donald**. It happened in default news subs. In the two years I have lurked (then started to participate) in the_donald, I have *never* seen anything even close to that. 

That is why so many people end up staying there after they check it out for themselves. They go there for entertainment, like an episode of Jerry Springer just to see how crazy some people are because everyone says it’s a group of racist, good for nothing bootlicking idiots. Then people see with their own eyes that’s completely false. Not only is it false, it’s normal people of all backgrounds who have found themselves united in Trump’s message (united in being American/patriotism) because they feel like either their party forgot them or they’re tired of constant identity politics and political correctness tearing everyone apart.

One day they will/can come for you.

Free speech and keeping this platform free even to fringe and offensive content is important and worth in my opinion it isn't in the admin (and yours) opinion.

So they eventually have more and more people going away (sadly because there are subreddits i enjoy here) and reddit himself will become more and more an echo chamber for a techentusiast/urbanite/leftwing/malebutnottoomuch crowd..

One thing that history teach is that censorship/isolating ideas/burning books is bad and has bad results.

The best thing reddit could do would be to bring back r/reddit.com or a similar official catchall that only applies reddit policy, and maybe restricts nsfw content.

Instead of attempting to enforce community standards on 1 million subreddits; they should focus on getting one decent public space right, and leave moderators be elsewhere.

This approach does not impede on existing communities, it creates a public space for the sort of cross-ideological discourse we desperately need.

Reddit describes itself as similar to a federal system of government.  But it's a government of a ""nation"" with effectively no public spaces.

The closing of r/reddit.com has made the rest of the site incredibly divisive, and restoring it is the biggest step reddit could make to connect diverse perspectives in a meaningful way.

Contrarily, if reddit starts banning conservative subreddits, then there is no place for people to discuss or show their support for conservative views.

Reddit as a platform is about free-speech (I'd argue most of the users don't actually support it, based on every single announcement post being filled with ""ban /r/the_Donald, I don't like conservatives!""), no one is saying subreddits need to be.

People seem to not understand that /r/the_Donald is not a political discussion subreddit. It's a Trump fan subreddit. They love Trump, and they post about how they love Trump and everything he does. You wouldn't go on /r/TaylorSwift and post about it how much she sucks and how she shouldn't have won X award because of Y and how she's ruining music. If you did, it wouldn't be surprising if a moderator removed your post. It goes against the intent of the subreddit.

/r/politics is a political discussion subreddit. It's an echo chamber, of course, but it's purpose is still discussion. That's why conservative views are not deleted. /r/LateStageCapitalism is the best analog to /r/the_Donald. It's a subreddit that is for the support of a specific idea, not the discussion of that idea, they are both circlejerks, and they both like to talk about their beliefs outside of their subreddit (which is perfectly allowed btw, these users are not brigading, they are just users who are passionate about something and also visit other subreddits).",5,e6t8iwx,Baerog,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7f8df3cb44d0>,t1_e6sujcg,1538159664

4337,">free speech, in the abstract, is a virtue unto itself and must therefore be protected at all costs. But of course that's a subjective point of view, as is every position about what is a virtue and what is not.

And that's where you begin to lose the argument. You're immediately discredited from that point on, and every point after that simply compounds upon this illogical fallacy.

Your view of rights being subjective stems from the fact that there's no ""true"" way to view anything ethical/psychological/morality based as objective by dint of it being a fabrication of humanity. That however does not make it subjective. By following the golden rule of ""Do unto others as you'd have done to you"" (not that religion has anything to do with this, this ideology existed far before religion), demonstrates that there are objective truths WITHIN humanity. Your simply need to change the scope of the investigation, if you're observing a psychological merit you need to do it from a psychological standpoint. No one wants to be murdered, burguled, tortured, or silenced. For those that do exhibit abnormal behavior in the vice to what the populous sees as true we have a well defined term for to describe their mental abnormalities: ""fetishists"". If you truly believe you're allowed to silence others based on your personal feelings, you demonstrate a clear and demonstrable mental abnormality, and should be treated as such.

I'm not saying your right to say ignorant shit should be violated, but you do deserve criticism for trying to spread falsehood as truth.

Sure, maybe it's not the best example, and they are very different things, but that doesn't preclude them from having similar side effects. Focus less on *how* they do and more on *what* they do. If we constructed a Venn Diagram, what's in the overlapping area? DRM and quarantining both make content harder to access unless you go looking for how to access it. They go about doing it completely different ways, but their end results have similarities. Like I said, sure, it might be a stretched example, but I don't think its hard to see their similarities.

>  they just don't want to publicly list all of their ""most offensive"" content.

True, and they shouldn't. Labelling offensive content is great to help people stay away, but it's also great for bots who now have an additional classification input to learn what bad content is and how to make it.

4647,"> if you disagree take it up with Marx.

By this logic, should anybody who watches media that glorifies violence should be judged guilty as if they had committed a violent crime? Like because Marx calls for violence, anybody who supports Marx's theories is beyond a supporter of a violent ideology, *but should be treated as if they themselves personally called for violence?*

Don't get me wrong: I am a Marxist. This is to say that I recognize the scientifically accurate model for understanding history and society in the context of dialectic materialism; that I believe that capitalism is not only an unfair system, but an ultimately inefficient and illogical way of organization a society's production; that the end to capitalism is not only necessary for the survival of humans on this planet, but is a historical inevitability that will be rendered false only with the environmental constraints of our home crushing us as a species.

This is my opinion--one I personally think is a founded one--but nonetheless my opinion. So far so good.

As a Marxist, I furthermore recognize that not only *can* the bourgeoisie--the tiny group of parasites that have direct control over the overwhelming majority of the world's resources--protect their position with violence, that they not only have a *vested interest* in doing so, but most importantly *have very openly* murdered millions of people (and continue to do so to this day) in order to protect their position. And as a Marxist, the combination of communism's necessity and the bourgeoisie's unwillingness to allow humanity to progress makes an armed struggle necessary.

Again, this is my opinion. I have not, in this space, endorsed or called for violence. Only because I recognize the limitations of this platform, both legal and economic. *However*, it would be *asinine* to categorically sanction this as ""hate speech"" and hold it equivalent to calling for violence.

If you disagree, then what do you think about /r/USMC/? Or /r/Capitalism/? Or /r/liberalism? How about /r/democrats/ or /r/Republican/? Those last two are subreddits for parties that have gone *faaaar* beyond ""calling for violence"". They have *actually* KILLED millions of people, IN REAL LIFE. These communities amount to legitimizing, popularizing, and justifying *literal ethnic cleansing campaigns*.

I don't think that those should be banned, even though I think that those parties should be excised from this planet like the cancer that they are. I do, however, think fascist subreddits should be banned. Because unlike capitalist or socialist ideology, fascism is *ideologically bereft*. There is no other belief in fascism besides violence. For capitalism and Marxism, violence is just a medium, a tool that is used *alongside* a fully-fledged ideology. Violence does not by any means *define* capitalism or communism. But it does define fascism.

But beyond that, you're necessarily using a completely arbitrary standard of morality that conveniently overlooks the very real, almost omnipresent manifestation of capitalism's violence.",33,e6rajbj,StalinIII,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7f8df3896f90>,t1_e6r8mm4,1538082239

4686,"I don't claim to have a firm or authoritative definition but I'd say that they break down thus:

- epistemic would be the construction of a body of rhetoric and 'knowledge' that serves only to provide justification for physical violence against a group. A good example would be the ideological campaign run by Hutu Power in Rwanda through the 60s-90s - creating 'facts' that contravene anthropological, archeological, cultural, linguistic, and genetic evidence in order to argue that the Tutsi were a different race, rather than social class.

- hypothetical is fairly easy to agree on: imagined or planned acts of violence discussed in earnest. You can see numerous examples of this on T_D with comments discussing the hanging/lynching of political opponents often staying up for months before mod removal

- political is hard to distinguish from epistemic violence as it follows the same form basis of justification, except instead of physical violence it's carried out through malicious engineering of the political systems. Stuff like jerrymandering, removal of voting polls from low-income neighborhoods, and voter ID all target specific demographics in was that - while they may not be physically violent - harm the existence of those people through the theft of their political agency and basic rights.

Who decides on these definitions?

 We all do.

In Marxist theory, imperialism refers to the ""imperialist countries"" exporting surplus capital (from the finance sector) to the global periphery in order to extract raw materials and other commodities for cheaper than the domestic labor can produce, to sustain the comparatively higher standards of living. It's not formal colonialism, but it shares similarities in how it gets commodities from the colonized nations.

4694,"""Um, they took opium voluntarily. It's a shitty business practice to put that much opium on the market but they just provided the rope. They didn't tie it, put it on, and jump. The US choosing to not trade with someone also doesn't mean it's at fault. You can't demand the US trade with everyone on everyone else's terms. Some of those sanctions are to punish governments that hurt their own people, by the fucking way.""

When the Chinese government attempted to crack down on the flow of opium into their country do you know what Western nations did? They used force to maintain the opium trade. Although, I love how you brush off Western nations funneling opium into China as innocent trade, but in nearly the same breath state that sanctions are to punish the bad governments. Sanctions on bad governments is good (even though it punishes the populace more), but the Chinese government trying to stop Western drug pushers is bad. By the fucking way, if you honestly believe that sanctions are put in place to ultimately help the people of the countries that they target then I have a bridge in the Sahara to sell you. 

""What happened to the indigenous people of North America was tragic, but A) they were fighting and slaughtering each other long before Europeans arrived and B) the deaths the United States caused in Native American communities don't touch the amount of people killed by communism, and the US is a very different country today.""

Holy fuck. Really? You are so concerned about all those tragic deaths under communism, but you hand wave away a literal attempt at genocide because indigenous communities had armed conflict, commies are bad, and America isn't that way anymore?

I guess we can excuse the deaths under communism because the all the different populations that lived under the USSR all had armed conflicts before the Bolshevik Revolution, right? 

As for point B. Let us pop a neat little thought experiment here. Let us say that someone kidnaps your mother, forces her to speak a new language under threat of violence, rapes her, and does all sorts of horrible things to her that ultimately leads to them murdering her. Now lets say that someone goes off and kills 24 people in a cold blooded mass shooting. How would you feel if the media and people in general brushed off your mother's death and mistreatment as ""tragic"", but not nearly as bad as that mass shooting because she was only one person who was murdered compared to twenty four people. Then people packed up and did almost nothing to address your mother's death. Would you feel the same way about that as you do about attempted indigenous genocide perpetrated by America?

As for the claim that America is a different nation today, well, I just don't think you've been paying attention. Secret prisons, extra judicial killing of foreign nationals, support of Saudi proxy wars, and so on and so on.

""Vietnam was not our finest moment, that's fair enough.""

That is all you have to say? So you care so deeply for all the deaths caused by communism, but the death and trauma caused by America in Vietnam gets the equivalent of a ""meh""? 

""However, the death tolls there also don't touch communism. Furthermore, you can blame France and communist influences for that shit show too.""

First, I'd love to see what figures you are working with and where you got them. There is a ton of misinformation regarding the death tolls and the circumstances surrounding them. That really isn't the important thing here. The important thing here is how you are demanding that communism as a whole (when it did achieve a lot of good too) be roundly condemned all the time on the basis that it killed more people than other ideologies. That sets a precedent regarding evil (your word) that is almost solely dependent on body counts rather than the material consequences of evil actions. Which is fucking dangerous bullshit. I mean, look at how easily you've been able to brush aside actual fucking evil acts because body counts.",2,e6z5v7x,,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7f8df318e610>,t1_e6y7l2f,1538412473

Don't worry, I'm willing to explain to young children who don't know any better.

Basically, Extreme Left Wing Ideology is literal communism and anarchism. Extreme Right Wing Ideology is Imperialism and Fascism. The difference being the level of economic exploitation against subjugated groups. 

Mainstream Left Wing Ideology is Social Democracy, represented by Bernie Sanders and 'Labour/Labor' parties around the world.  Mainstream Right Wing Ideology is Conservatism. This is represented by the GOP and other Conservative Parties.  There is of course a third faction - Centrism. These are people who are socially and economically liberal. This is the core ideology of the US Democrat Party, the current Canadian PM's party, and the French President's Party. These ideologies are the ones that normally take power in the majority of countries. It is of course not this rigid, mainstream politics at the moment mostly flows across these three positions and not into the Extreme ends of the spectrum, thus Mainstream politics is mostly in the centre of the economic spectrum. 

r/Politics is not extreme, it falls squarely into mainstream politics, very much in a centrist position. If it was calling for collective ownership of capital and for the eradication of the ruling class, it would be on the extreme left. If it was calling for genocide or the enslavement of a race of people, it would be on the extreme right. It does neither, it is not extreme. Just because there's a hostile environment towards people of conservative or fascistic views, doensn't make them far left.

Thought experiment: Imagine you're a rabid anti-trumper on r/againsthatesubreddits or one of the similar anti-trump subs.

I've always found this to be an impressively flawed argument. Censorship doesn't say anything about the state. The principle of free speech exists outside law. If a government makes murder legal, does that make it right? The whole idea of a law is to enforce a pre-existing principle.

Fighting to silence those with opinions you don't like (and as far as I can tell ""fascist"" at this point just means somebody who you don't agree with) is a bad way to go about the world, a dangerous way to live, and do you not think that if it becomes a popular tool for social and political competition that it wont end up being employed at the government level?

Just exactly HOW braindead can you manage to get, you dumbass fool... I can literally cite entire generations and thousands of instances in america that railed against the desensitization of media, music, movies, speeches, social standards. Literally entire generations that scoffed at even the notion you had a kid and weren't married. Kissing in public. Do you have any idea the social wars that were had over how women dress or the supreme court cases that were fought over music and television? Or how people who had opinions on civil rights were shot dead right on stages? America never supported censorship? It was the social standard of our entire history!!! Only in the last 50 years has America conceded completely to those against censorship. And not willingly.

> While living in a nation that has never supported censorship.

An ENTIRE generation fought against the hippy free love  rennaissance, are you dumb? Censorship was used routinely as a weapon of war. Did you even know that?

But the more you drill into it the more it comes a question of what does ""in favor"" mean. Also are we including people who associate with people who are ""in favor of genocide""?

Maybe for myself it's a matter of who someone chooses to hate. 

Because when one says ""A Nazi"" there's a million different interpretations of what that is.

In the most traditional sense it would be the people in germany at the time of the holocaust. But these new people who call themselves? Neo-Nazis, or support hitler or whatever. These are different people with different goals.

I will do (have done) a lot to help prevent it, walking people home, calling them a cab, being cautinary when someone “creeps me out”, advocating for legal CSW and treating addiction as a health problem (to reduce the profitability and control of traffickers), etc.

I would *never* fault a person for acting in self defense, or someone coming to their aid. If I did intervene, I would do my best to not kill the attacker, but I’d certainly try less hard than say confronting a thief or engaging in civil disobedience. I wouldn’t support the idea that a cop has more or less “authority”, or deserves more legal protections than a Good Samaritan. I’d also suggest the vast majority of what law enforcement does in a jurisdiction has almost nothing to do with violent crime, and may create or contribute the cycles of poverty and abuse which primes the next generation of violent individuals.

I’d also suggest that genocide would be much more difficult without the concentration of wealth and power into states — or corporations, though they tend to at least have some function where they must compete for consumer loyalty, where killing is going to be negative for business, especially in a connected world where it is harder to hide abusive behaviors.

At some point, I think humanity needs to break the cycle of violence and abuse, which I don’t think states are an indeal institution to lead in that regard — but would say societies (or states) that reduce militarism are healthier, even if it just transfers the spending to non-violent, non-enforcement (ideally voluntary) programs.

I think the major difference is the definition of violence and the degree to which a power can increasingly regulate the affairs of individuals within the nation-state. They aren’t putting people in stocks or doing public executions, but putting someone in jail for increasingly unharmful or victimless variations on human behavior is not non-violent either. State jurisdictions are inherently geographic, but the sociocultural norms of the area are far more fluid.

Ultimately, most non-violent state mandates or taxes eventually escalate to capture and incarceration if a person resists. If not wage garnishment, puts an employer in the position of complying with (what I would consider) theft.

I’d also say that nothing happens in a vacuum, and it is always harder to scientifically identify a cause in the social sciences versus physical sciences because there is not an adequate control population for world-wide institutions or systems.

He asked the mods to reconsider and they said to get back to them in THREE MONTHS. /r/politics does not tolerate any kind of calls for violence. t_d encourages calls to violence. You're the bad ones. You're the violent ones. Acknowledge that and then please turn your life around. History will not be kind to the MAGA cult.

5178,"That might help, but I don't think it will do anything to solve the problem of subsets of users self-selecting and self-radicalizing into these isolated communities in fringe subs.

I think the main problem that crops up in these echochamber subs is that once a narrative is established, any posts that criticize or poke holes in that narrative are nuked off the sub by a combination of heavy-handed/ban-happy mods and hyperactive radical users who organize to quickly mass downvote. This prevents newer, not yet radical users from seeing any dissenting information on the subs in question. Instead they get fed a constant stream of whatever tripe the sub is about, and the slow slide into madness is pretty much guaranteed.

Reddit has been trying to tackle this by using various strategies like quarantines to force subreddit mods to be more even-handed and stop misusing their ban and remove powers, but I still see this as only solving half the problem. Once an echo-chamber sub gets established enough, and gets enough dedicated users, they are capable of enforcing the narrative in the sub without assistance from the sub's moderators.

My suggestion is for the admins to go a step further, and to have quarantined subs ""lose the downvote privilege"". That way, a hivemind of radical users will not be able to bury all critical posts on the sub. Even if they're surrounded by highly upvoted kool-aid, a typical user browsing the sub would still be able to see critical or disagreeing posts fairly regularly. 

Doing this would also encourage redditors from outside the sub's insular community to engage and make more of these critical posts. Like, right now, even though I know T_D is a terrible echochamber full of easily refuted propaganda, I don't go post there because I know nobody will see my comment and I don't want to eat the downvotes. If I knew I could go post critical comments there without the ""risk"" of being nuked with downvotes, I'd be much more likely to do so. Other redditors are probably similar.

5191,"Some people seem to believe that free speech results in a murky fog of opposing views, where one cannot easily discern the truth. And I must stress, that murkiness can result from perfectly good intent. For example, Canadian PM Trudeau was recently photographed at a town hall that was not quite half full. The CBC's photo was from the side, and it appeared to show the PM as the centre of an adoring crowd. A Toronto Sun shot was from the back of the hall, making it appear more empty than it was. Each shot was honest, and not Photoshopped, and yet would lead to two different impressions. Multiply that by a million other events elsewhere, each intersecting and interfering with or reinforcing, a million other events, and the murkiness alluded to appears. 

The word 'truth' does not apply here. Both photos alluded to above were true in every sense of the word. Each would be accepted in a court of law without question, where the lawyers would spin the impressions. And it is those impressions that are the real issue. 

We now live a significant portion of our lives in the cybersphere. It is the 100-eyed Argus writ large, allowing us to peer intently and deeply into every aspect of each other's lives, and sites like Reddit facilitate it. One question is, can our society withstand that level of scrutiny? 

But another, more important question concerns virtual communities. Napoleon was said to have understood the grammar of gunpowder; Trump understood the subtext of Twitter. *Pace* McLuhan, the Twitter medium was the message, as it subverted the traditional power brokers of TV and print, and allowed direct and instantaneous communication between candidate and voter. It didn't matter what any single Tweet - the 'content' in McLuhan's terms - contained; it created a brand new communication path that let data buzz. In the same way that Netflix obviated Blockbuster, and Amazon busted bookstores, Twitter both reduced the importance of the ""MSM"", and allowed the frictionless birth of new tribes, now as simple as saying ""#M2"".  These tribes grew or failed as they attracted and lost followers, but could also link up with other tribes. If one thinks of things musically, each tribe has its own sound, and when those sounds harmonized with other tribe's, they would create a virtual hum, the largest of which so far gave Trump the presidency. 

Extending the acoustic metaphor, there are those who insist some sounds are just too cacophonous to be tolerated, and cannot be given any hearing. And we do have this to some extent today, as most places have policies that forbid outright racist, sexist, libellous, etc. comments, and I'm glad they do. I'm sure we've all experienced blogs going downhill with threads degenerating from reasonably shared opinions to flame wars that are stupid and, worse, boring. Perhaps the Earth is flat, or Jews do run the world, but does it have to be discussed everywhere? I'm glad I don't have to scroll through that. I don't mind being able to 'tune out' that frequency, permanently. 

However, I do want to know what frequencies are out there. I listen to AccuRadio to hear new stuff I didn't know existed; one follows a new hashtag, deciding, as you like a song, whether to participate and add to that tag's 'buzz', or a Reddit post, creating a different buzz.  I don't want anyone else deciding what subs should rise to Reddit's front page if I'm following New or Hot - I want to see what's going with the most important tribes. I don't want anyone restricting the frequencies I'm allowed to sample. I'm an adult, and if I'm shocked or disgusted, I've learned how to turn away. I'm not asking anyone to provide me with a sanitized experience. 

So to beat the metaphor to death, we are all our own little symphonies. We hope our families harmonize so each of us stronger together than we are apart. We try to do the same with our tribes. Social media let those harmonies grow, which produced unexpected results, such as Pres DJT. Through co-ordinated actions, what I'll call the ""Dark Tone"" using tools such as Tweetbans, Facebook unposts, Youtube disappearances, etc., can quite effectively silence some harmonies. They've already eliminated Alex Jones from most major platforms. Whether he was a one-off situation, or a test case to see how quickly and easily it could be done, remains to be seen. 

I call it the ""Dark Tone"" because it is not Soros or Hillary or Zurich's gnomes behind it it. Like Trump's wave, it is a growing, self-reinforcing, and censorious wave of *emotion* passing through the cybersphere, and like a blaring trumpet next to a string quartet, completely destroying the music of the moment. It is not controlled by any human being. No one planned it. It grows organically because no one dares oppose it, gathering momentum as each new virtue-signaller piles on, and steam-rolling over everyone. I believe Cosby was guilty, as was Weinstein. Both have paid a price. Who knows what to believe about Kavanagh, except him and the woman? But the Dark Tone is swelling against him and whether he can resist it will be interesting. 

The Dark Tone clearly inhabits Reddit. I spend less time on it now as the Dark Tone mutes my enjoyment. I find fewer stories I want to read. The Dark Tone is a monotone, and wants to Borg-ify us. I say, ""No thank you"".

5202,"The amount of people who use the gutenberg project to educate themselves is negligible compared to the amount of people who read some random bullshit some schizophrenic conspiracy theorist, terrorist group, anti-vaccination group, Russian intelligence agency etc.. (I mean the list really does go on) is able to put out there. Reddit has got to a point where it has an incredible social responsibility, which although the founders might have envisioned was nowhere near fruition a decade ago. You don't think libraries back in the day were selective of the content they chose to store? Or that the people with the access to those technologies tried to use them for the good of humanity instead of spreading whatever filth they could?

&#x200B;

I agree that freedom of speech is important in terms of truth and justice, but there will always be limitations beyond slippery slope arguments that are necessary in upholding those same principles. There's a reason why books about holocaust conspiracy theories are not in the WWII History section of a given library. It's because they are demonstrably and verifiably false. You can still find those works, they are just not granted the same shelf space.

The reason why this has always been the case ever since the advent of stores of written information is because not all information is equal. We should all have access to it, but it should not and has never been advertised as equally important.

So keep those areas of free speech in their own quarantined corner, freely available to all with the disclaimer that it is widely known as being horse shit. Don't put Joe Anti-Vaxx's theories on the same shelf as a medical publication which has been around for generations, which subjects itself to much more rigorous standards, spent countless resources in an exhaustive unbiased delve into that same subject matter. Don't put Adolf Jr's horseshit cherry picking account of the holocaust next to works which thousands more hours were put into getting as accurate and unbiased accounts of the atrocities as possible. Don't allow terrorist groups like ISIS to spread ridiculous propaganda which radicalizes thousands of young people on the same platform as you give to the people who champion individual liberties, peace, and equality.

*Mavrix v Livejournal*. The Ninth Circuit Appeals holds the view that any user-content-hosting ISP (of which Reddit is one) that has the ability and resources to have paid employees that function as content editors, have the ability and resources to have paid employee content editors exercise agency on the company's behalf to prevent reasonably suspected copyright violations; That, in turn, affects the ability of the company to take shelter under the DMCA's Safe Harbour provision, making the company civilly liable for **_every copyright violation_** occurring on the site.

All it would take is for a handful of accounts to upload the text of a bunch of science papers to various subreddits (and movies, and film scripts, and photos, and music) and then aiming a smattering of publishers at Reddit, and Reddit winds up in bankruptcy, being sold to Time Warner.

Reddit (, stylized in its logo as reddit) is an American social news aggregation, web content rating, and discussion website. Registered members submit content to the site such as links, text posts, and images, which are then voted up or down by other members. Posts are organized by subject into user-created boards called ""subreddits"", which cover a variety of topics including news, science, movies, video games, music, books, fitness, food, and image-sharing. Submissions with more up-votes appear towards the top of their subreddit and, if they receive enough votes, ultimately on the site's front page.

I don't really care about the existence of this sub because, in the grand scheme of things, it doesn't do much. But nobody should say it's ""just another sub"". It has nothing in common with the porn subs you listed (which highly objectify women, but that's a different topic).

There is a nuance between the two. Just because the supremacists of /r/whitebeauty don't post anything vulgar or offensive (although their comments are something else entirely, you should read some of them) doesn't mean they aren't ideologically motivated. There is nothing racist in recognizing that different skin colours exist, and the porn subs you listed don't glorify the existence of the race, they're just wank material of a particular kind. In that sense they have more in common with other porn subreddits about particular sex acts than /r/whitebeauty.

And I'm sure regulars will now flock to my comment and tell me it's all just a joke and I shouldn't take it seriously. Yeah, sure, it always is a joke. Talking about an Aryan übermodel was just a bait. But why isn't any post in /r/asiancuties or /r/EbonyPorn titled like this?

5452,"There are a few misconceptions in this comment I'd like to clear up. 

What you'll hear communists say is ""they deserved worse"", not ""they deserved death"", in reference to a class of people (the kulaks) who literally hoarded and burned food during times of famine (of which there were plenty in Russia before the 1917 revolution), and were punished by being sent to prisons that had *much* better conditions than prisons in the US and other capitalist nations (many got their own house, and up to 500 000 prisoners were released each year). 

So when you see ""they deserved worse"" it's not much different than when a rapist gets 1 year in prison, for example, and people say ""he got off easy"" or something of that nature. 

Secondly, you won't find any of those subs talking about ""the middle class"". That's a term used by Liberals, not Marxists. In Marxist analysis, there's the working class, or the proletariat, and the ruling/ownership class, or the bourgeoisie. 

What most liberals consider the middle class would either be known to communists as working class or petty bourgeoisie. Not one of those subs talk about ""the middle class doesn't deserve to live"". Communists don't even strive to kill the bourgeoisie. All communists strive for is for the workers to own the means of production, instead of people who earned capital through inheritance or exploitation claiming the rights to something that was/is created and operated by workers. No one should own the product of *human* invention, because no *one* person invents something. We all work together to create and innovate, and all workers in an organization should have a democratic say in the operation of the organization, and society itself.

No one is censoring you. Many subs have been banned over the years. Your precious t_d sub isn't even on the quarantined list, so you can get over that victim complex you all seem to have. The right has control of the House, Senate, Supreme Court, and White House, but can't seem to shut up about being oppressed and censored.

One thing Aaron was wrong about is that private companies, even his, can do whatever they want and should not be elected (this is a capitalist society, after all, right?). Also, when you no longer have a stake in that company (for whatever reason), you no longer have the ability to influence their actions. 

It's ironic, the no regulation free market retards like yourself are more than happy to cry about private companies' actions when they make decisions you don't like. ",-8,e6r8f2j,,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7f8df30c4250>,t1_e6r7xb5,1538080663

If a gay couple shows up at a hotel and wants to pay for a special gay-themed hotel room, the hotel should be under no obligation to honor their request. If the couple doesn't like the regular hotel rooms, they are free to ask another hotel for special accommodations.  

Free speech in social media is a little different. We don't have a right to gay wedding cakes, but we do have a right to free speech. We also have a natural right to life and liberty. This basic human right is the basis for anti-discrimination laws like the Civil Rights Act. At some point, public accommodations became a necessity rather than a luxury. We live in a developed society and it is no longer possible for most people to make their own way and live off the land. Okay, a few people can manage it, but resources and space are too limited to accommodate our population without the organization of a developed society. Being forced to live without access to public accommodations means we suffer and probably die. Discrimination makes it possible for society to destroy the natural right to life and liberty. Even though the individual business are privately owned, they are part of a new paradigm of privatizing and monetizing the natural order and so basic access became a civil right.  

Likewise, social media networks have become part of the new paradigm of privatizing and monetizing the public discourse. This is now so total and pervasive that other forms of speech are quickly becoming marginalized and obsolete. There is a strong argument to be made for viewing free speech in social media as a civil right. It's not the rights that have changed, it is the nature of speech that has changed. The social media companies may be privately owned, but allowing them to form a digital parallel society makes it possible for free speech rights to be effectively destroyed.  

I think there is a strong argument for something like a Digital Rights Act. ISPs and hosting companies should only discriminate based on the amount of data being transmitted or stored, not by the type of data (with the possible exceptions of illegal material or malicious code). Likewise, any website that operates as a general forum should be neutral towards content (with the possible exceptions of illegal material or malicious code). Curated forums should still be fine as long as it's clear what the intent is. But if you advertise your company as the ""frontpage of the internet"", or something similar, then administrative curation should be entirely hands off (i.e. reserved only for illegal behavior). This kind of legislation would actually protect companies like Reddit from advertisers applying pressure for censorship of users.  

Just because the public square is now digitized and privately owned does not change anything about our basic expectation of free expression. If a social media company doesn't like that, there is nothing forcing them to stay in the business of monetizing public speech.

Pacifism is only a meaningful term if it is absolute, or qualified with something else like ""pacifist protesting"" which would not mean the rejection of self defense. 

>genocide would be much more difficult without the concentration of wealth and power into states — or corporations

It's also arguable that the concentration of wealth and power into states is the main thing that can prevent a genocide. If there were no states, there'd be little to stop a violent group organising. The most powerful and reprobate members of society would become dominant were the ""good"" people not willing to organise in defense of the weak and powerless. If they were willing to organise in that, you might as well call that a state. Tolstoyan pacifism made Russian society ripe to be overtaken by tyrants. The very well known pacifist Vera Brittain argued against British intervention in WW2, which the recent film about her life completely left out since it would make her look like a terrible person.

>societies (or states) that reduce militarism are healthier

Like Switzerland and Sweden, who effectively sided with the Nazis? The fact that the USA rather than Russia or China is the dominant power has been a really great thing for the world. It may not last. If the US were to become a pacifist isolationist country how would that possibly help the world?

If you despise the system of coercion the state imposes, what alternative do you propose in an anarchist society to prevent people from murdering each other and committing acts infringing on others' freedom?

We have been living in organized ""states"" or proto-states for a far shorter period of time than we have been left to our own devices (ie, living in small family units or communities). Before the advent of civilization and the social contract, life was, as Hobbes puts it, ""Nasty, Brutish and Short"". Warfare has been proved to exist, to some degree, even in Apes living in the wild.

Standard of living and life expectancy has drastically increased with the modern state and the organization of agriculture. Simply think of vaccination as well. Could a plethora of small communes been able to pool ressources into eradicating Polio? 

What about when another community decides to organize differently or take by force what belongs to another?

Whatever ills you associate to modern civilization, the alternative appears to me to be worse. Additionally, those ills are not the same in every state. Not every country criminalizes drugs, for example, the way the US does.

Lets not even talk about how retarded it is the amount of people that voted for hillary just bc she’s a woman. voting someone bc of their gender is the most MORONIC thing you can do. imagine if i voted for hillary just bc i like blonde hair. 

also ive always been curious about this one, if trump is such a misogynist etc, what is bill? definitely the same if not worse as trump, and hillary belittled all the women her fucking husband raped.

5849,"Taken from another comment:

To play devil's advocate for a moment reasons for banning T_D could include:

Brigadeing of other subreddits

That guy they encouraged to kill his father who then went and killed his father

Encouraging of Doxxing

Organized abuse. The admins banned fatpeoplehate for less than what happens on T_D daily

Advocating for genocide

Racism. Pretty much everyone from the banned coontown sub (I may be misremembering the name) seems to have blocked to T_D

Illegal activities. T_D is a haven for Russian propaganda

Spreading misinformation (for example, as stated in this very announcement post, I've seen ""the Holocaust is a hoax"" perpetrated on T_D by many users)

To be clear, I'm playing devil's advocate here. I don't believe T_D should be banned, it should be quarantined.

Second comment:

I'm going to make a bet that someone with the username LONGLIVEDONALDTRUMP probably isn't the most unbiased source here.

But sure, here's sources:

The T_D user who killed his father for calling him a Nazi and was encouraged by T_D users. Admittedly I just grabbed the first article on the subject I found. I also am unable to find the specific instances of where he was egged on on his profile but it appears his comment history has been largely removed.

Conveniently his profile does give proof of my other claims. Here he is spreadding misinformation that CNN is ISIS or at least in league with ISIS which is laughable.

Here he is spreading that because a black comedian made a joke all of Hollywood hates white people.

The Huffington post hates white people and wants to start a civil war. Propaganda, racism, misinformation, inciting violence home run. Comments are sexism, calls for violence against women, calls for violence against non-whites, threats that the alt-right will win the so-called ""civil war"", and other forms of racism.

A post supporting racism against people who spell correctly for some reason.

Russian propaganda being spread.

More Russian propaganda being spread.

Inciting violence against blacks and claiming a civil war has started.

Russian propagagnda

Russian propaganda

And yet MORE perpetuating of Russian propaganda.

So, the only things I didn't find in scraping this guys account are direct orders to doxx sites (though that was implied by some of them) or to brigade other subs. This guy has been in prison for over a year. And what started the fight that led to him killing his father? He was ""out of control"" spouting ""things from the internet"" and claiming that toddlers could consent to sex when his father called him a Nazi so he killed his father. Yeah, T_D is just the sweetest place I'm sure.

End of comments

So yes, T_D meets criteria not just for quarantining but also for banning. We'll never hear from /u/spez
, /u/landoflobsters
, or any other admin why they won't do either though.

I (and the majority of conservatives in America) think that the left has invented the entire rape accusations against Kavanaugh just to delay his appointment until after the mid term elections when they think they'll win a house majority.

A far as we're concerned, the politcal left and the biased left leaning news media are using their free speech to spread massive amounts of lies and disinformation. Innuendos and half baked, ridiculous slander that will irresponsibly damage a good man's life and career.

Should I have the power to quarantine r/news and r/politics for spreading these lies and hoaxes? 

See, heres the rub that you and those with your mindset just aren't getting. Just because *you* believe something is the truth or a lie, doesn't necessarily mean that it *is* a truth or a lie.

You might indeed think Kavanugh is a rapist. That doesn't make it true. You might think Trump is a racist. That doesn't make it true. You might think that someone who refuses to believe in white privilege is a supremacist. That doesn't make it true. You might think that someone who thinks the wage gap is a myth is a misogynist. That doesn't make it true. You might think people who only believe in two genders are transphobic. That doesn't make it true.

So you see what I'm getting at here? Because as a conservative, I find r/news, r/politics, r/esist, r/againsthatesubreddits, r/fuckthealtright, r/politcalhumor, r/bestof, r/sandersforpresident, r/LateStageCapitalism, r/shitredditsays, and a hundred other left leaning subreddits to be echo chambers of hoaxes and lies that are far more full of hateful, ignorant, violent people than I ever see in any conservative subreddits.

This is the opposite of what I said. Learn to strawman. The Holocaust can't be denied because there is actual proof that it happened. Testimonies, corpses, mass graves, confiscated personal belongings, photographs, and documented records.

By the same token, the so-called ""Holodomor"", i.e. famine related deaths as a somehow deliberate genocide can absolutely be denied. That's because there's no evidence to suggest that it was deliberate, kulaks are not an ethnic group, but rather a class, and most importantly--the exact opposite is supported by evidence: that the deaths were caused by kulaks who would rather die and kill millions of innocents than observe the conditions that were democratically established for land ownership.

Let's be clear: *the kulaks literally killed themselves*. The true mistake that Lenin, then Stalin made was allowing them to survive as a class (note: I said *as a class*), precipitating the unnecessary deaths of so many others.

By leftist understanding of capitalism, especially by labor theory of value, the existence of a capitalist class *is* little more than a parasitic class.

Yes, I am definitely denying that.

> When you combine this with the history of communists violently genociding ""bourgeoisie"" - such as Kulaks - you can begin to see how this becomes comparable to describing certain ethnic groups as parasites.

Except that the bourgeoisie is not an ethnic group--nor are Kulaks. Unlike ethnicity, class is a completely artificial concept that can be chosen. Your ethnicity is not something you have any control over, nor does your ethnicity compel you to exploit, enslave, or murder others. On the other hand, the very fundamental operating principles of capitalism *compel* the bourgeoisie, by definition, to exploit, enslave, and murder others. And even if it hadn't, the people targeted by communists *are people who actually have exploited, enslaved, and murdered others*.

> Now I'm not saying you personally are calling for violence, infact you seem mostly reasonable, but much of these communist subreddits are not reasonable

That's a point I can agree on. I don't entirely support everything that goes on in these subs and I don't think I really like the ironic distance that a lot of the more over-the-top posts feature. That being said, I personally believe that violence against the bourgeoisie is both necessary and justified. Being a public platform with legal and economic limitations, I wouldn't openly call for explicit violence here. But I would encourage people to consider the arguments for it, study the experiences of the historically oppressed and their struggles, and prepare for the necessity of violence against the bourgeoisie.

Not for any arbitrary reason, the way that fascists call for violence against ethnic groups, and not for ethically bankrupt reasons, the way capitalists sanction violence against pretty much anybody for profit's sake. But simply because the bourgeoisie *is actively murdering people!* The Nazis killed far fewer than the US military kills today.

Funny enough even here you imply a desire for your opponents to shut up. Large supposedly politically neutral social media platforms have been kicking out and/or silencing right-wing and conservative viewpoints for a long time now. Are those on the right supposed to sit silently and just pretend that those websites are acting fairly across the political spectrum?

I agree, even if you most certainly don't, except for this case where it helps destroy your political opposition.

6281,"I mean I think there’s something about framing the kinds of material people generally find offensive as just “something someone dislikes” that kind of misses what people seem to be keying into when they call something ‘offensive.’ To me it seems that there is a meaningful distinction to be made between saying “that goes against my preferences” and “that is offensive to me.” I think the difference is more apparent with more extreme sorts of statements, so I’ll use a deliberately over the top statement as an example. So let’s say we have two statements: statement A, “We as a society should literally kill everyone with brown eyes because they are subhuman,” and statement B, “if you have brown eyes, you should listen to every Nickelback album.” (For reference, I have brown eyes).

Statement B I don’t find particularly offensive, I just disagree with it on the grounds that Nickelback is a band that doesn’t fit my aesthetic preferences. I’m not really harmed by such a statement, and wouldn’t even suffer much harm if the statement were actualized. On the other hand, we have statement A. Now, I don’t actually find find statement A particularly offensive, but let’s suppose that in the past, brown-eyed people have been systematically mistreated (e.g. genocided, denied rights, consistently socially stigmatized, whatever) in many countries in the world, including the one I live in. If that were the case, I probably would feel offended, in that Statement A would constitute a threat against my continued existence, as well as a speech act that seems to unfairly single me (and others like me) out and ascribe to me negative qualities. In a hypothetical society like the one I specified, statement A would actually be somewhat dangerous to me if left unchallenged, as it’s plausible that others might see it and try to act on it. And even if most people didn’t feel the need to act on it, even if they disagreed with it, repeating statements like statement A around them often enough might lead them to disregard its meaning and intent, until they were complacent about others adopting the idea behind statement A, perhaps even ultimately becoming complacent enough to allow others to act on statement A without protest. 

In this case, it would seem to be a mischaracterization to say that I “dislike” or “disagree with” statement A in the same way that I dislike and disagree with statement B, in that statement A both does an immediate harm to me by challenging my status as a person, and poses a danger to my continued existence. It’s therefore not just a matter of preference for me to oppose statement A (either by protesting against it or by attempting to silence people who make statements like it). Rather, it’s potentially necessary for my continued existence to oppose it (and under most moral systems, a moral necessity to oppose similar statements directed at others, but I’ve been typing for long enough and would rather not go into that).  Further, given the way genetics and relationship formation work, I would likely have many friends, family, and loved ones with brown eyes, so my opposition wouldn’t even be purely self-interested, but instead would also ultimately be a defense of others I care about. 

Now, obviously you could boil all that down to preference—e.g. “you merely prefer that you and your loved ones continue to live” but this seems to be a qualitatively different *kind* of preference compared to mundane preferences like, say, what kind of music I want to listen to. Similarly, you could construe violation of my mundane preferences as “harmful” but again, this seems to be a very different kind of harm than that implied by statement A.

Tl;dr: The way people talk about “offensiveness” isnt really about “liking”or “disliking,” it’s about harm and danger. ",1,e70ggxu,SSBM_Rosen,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7f8df2c53bd0>,t1_e70dauv,1538455392

Yes, it's less bad for reddit to remove a post or a sub than for an oppressive government to kill a journalist.  Just like a paper cut is less bad than being stabbed.  That doesn't make a paper cut a good thing though, it just makes it less bad than something worse.  So when you tell me ""oh come on it's just a paper cut"" and I explain to you my problem with cutting people generally, I'm not equating your paper cut to a stabbing, I'm just telling you why it's bad to cut people at all.

Yes, reddit censoring users is less bad than many other forms of censorship.  That doesn't make it somehow ok.  It's still bad.  It's still worse than *not censoring*.  It's still censorship and it's still the first step down a dark path.  Once you take that step and it is normalized, there's no reason not to take another step.  That's why I'm warning you and so adamant about not taking that first step to begin with.  When you normalize shitty behavior because it's not *too* terrible, all you do is move the center so that the next shitty thing is possible, whereas previously it would have rightly seemed much worse.

You're claiming I'm exaggerating because I'm equating the first small step to the thousandth step down the path.  But that's not what I'm doing.

6334,"“If you despise the system of coercion the state imposes, what alternative do you propose in an anarchist society to prevent people from murdering each other and committing acts infringing on others' freedom?” 

From the top down? Nothing. I, nor anyone else, has the inherent authority to impose anything on another person. No group is superior to any individual. 

I think that the premise is invalid. Anarchy is the natural state. I think the burden of moral/ethical proof is on the party advocating that it has some inherent authority to violate the sovereignty of an individual person. Most people argue that the benefit exceeds the cost, but to me that is a moral black hole. Apart from that, I generally think the world would operate more efficiently and humanely if it’s problems are managed by markets/networks/localized collectives/information sharing/consumer choice on an issue-by-issue/resource-by-resource/provider-by-provider basis over monolithic bureaucratic states.

Some institutions may look capitalist (market-based) or socialist (voluntary pooled risk/resources.) Most anarchists favor one or the other to the exclusion of the other. I tend to favor market systems, but have no inherent objection to voluntary socialism or communism.

Even in democratic societies, there is an idea of the “consent of the governed”, which I think falls far below what I consider the minimum moral standard for consent. Individuals don’t automatically consent to everything a state does merely by existing or being born in a specific location.

Even in self-defense or the immediate defense of person from bodily harm or death is the absolute limit for justifiable force. It is unjust to use violence to achieve some social goal, even if the goal is generally good, or makes desirable metrics rise.

Ultimately, it is the discretion of individuals if they are going to follow the principle of non-aggression. I do have more confidence that individuals will increasingly avoid violent acts without the psychological insulation of “just following orders.” If they reject violence, many other antisocial problems decrease, especially those caused by enforcement efforts/black markets.

Almost everything a state does, desirable or undesirable, is derived from an implicit or explicit claim to the right to use violence and/or coercion. For example, to my knowledge, the National Weather Service has no enforcement function, and I’d argue a weather forecasting service is a good thing. However, if it is funded by taxes, which are collected under threat of theft or arrest, it is an immoral solution to a legitimate social problem. Pruning solutions that require forced compliance and funding leaves voluntary solutions, many of which I’d argue are also superior in terms of efficacy, cost, accountability to stakeholders, etc.

Free riders are a problem, and some people are hopelessly violently antisocial. However, I’d suggest it is ultimately less of a problem, especially as the harmful effects of states and highly concentrated power dissipate.

From the bottom up? Whatever opportunities present themselves that meet one simple requirement. 

1. The directive of one party must not initiate violence or the threat of violence directly or in directly to another person.

If that is met, whether I participate or expect anyone else to, is ultimately their individual discretion. 

The ills are not the same. I can easily concede that. I can say in one regard that I think program A is better/worse than B for purpose C, or that country 1 does a better job of C than country 2. However, I will never advocate for either A or B if they are involuntary, which is to say coercive and ultimately violent.

If C is virtuous, I’ll happily support whatever of options D-Z is most ideal so long as they do not violate the principle of non-aggression.

Drugs are just one of the most aggregious examples to me. I don’t accept that any person or group has a right to regulate what another does with/for/to their own body. I would say that an insurance company may only cover drugs with third party verification of scientific validity as an element of the insurance contract, (the specific point where the patient explicitly consents, until revoked), but that it cannot generally interfere with a person opting to take them (or decline treatment) unless it uses violence (e.g., criminalization/regulation of drugs, involuntary commitment/treatment, “treatments” that are almost identical to prison,...).

I do not think it will be utopia. It is natural order, rather than prescribed order. Especially for outliers, I think it will be far more civil. Generally, I do think it will ultimately be less violent and more liberal than the current system.",1,e6wbrun,satsugene,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7f8df2ea2e10>,t1_e6vs4g5,1538291354

But I don’t, really, anymore. Not on net. I lived through the ’00s, the rise of blogging, those hopeful and naive times when it seemed like the Web would be the ultimate democratizing force, allowing a greater breadth of self-expression and helping the best ideas rise to the top.

That is not how things have turned out. The Web was *too* successful. Where communities used to be based on physical proximity, making different kinds of people spend time together and share a common interest, now more and more people’s main community is online, with people already similar to themselves. And those communities are Petri dishes, whose members become more and more like themselves, *too* much like themselves.

When it was just email forwards in the late ’90s and early ’00s it was bad enough, but with Twitter and Facebook and Reddit it’s just entirely out of control. And Slack and Discord are almost worse, because there the radicalizing happens out of public view.

And *all* the communities are radical in their own way. Flat-earthers, anti-vaxxers, t_d chuds and Chapo Trap House commies, feminists and MRAs and rationalists and milquetoast centrists, all of them are too much like themselves, to the exclusion of other personality types, and getting worse every week they spend with each other online.

> Criminalizing the sharing of pornography allows law enforcement resources to be allocated to targeting producers and distributers of child pornography.

Murder is criminalized, but videos of murders are not.  Does this make it harder for law enforcement resources to be allocated to targeting murderers?

It is possible to believe that child abuse is wrong and still criticize the legal framework surrounding CP.

My own view is that strict legal liability for the position of digital data is fundamentally dangerous to free society.

Consider the similar situation of drug posession, it’s known that police officers will sometimes take advantage of this strict liability to frame people (usually minorities) by planting evidence.

With drugs, at least their ability to do so is somewhat limited by the quantity of contraband an officer has at their disposal.

This is not the case with contraband that can be infinitely replicated at near zero cost.

Theres a difference between ""i disagree with open immigration and will vote accordingly here are my reasons.."" and ""i dont talk to muslim loving scum. Get rekt libtard"". Should both of these types users have the same protections? How about communities?

I think there needs to be a understanding that the reality of internet communication can actually inhibit free speech. Take for example when a bad acting subreddit raids a given post and the moderators close the thread. Happens a lot on political blackpeopletwitter posts. In these situations, the free speech of that community is hampered because of the bad faith of some. The reality is mod teams cant keep up. The moderation (at the admin level) of bad acting communities is paramount to the free speech of the rest.

I’m not trying to convince anyone, I’m just offering an alternate perspective for people who want to hear from someone who has been active there for over two years rather than melodramatic, and often fabricated, hackneyed insults from people who do not visit that sub unless they’re expressly looking for something to reinforce their current worldview. 

Hours old accounts posting hateful content and taking a screenshot of it isn’t an example of it organically promoting hate. Literally everyone is welcome to support Trump. There is no discrimination in being proud to be an American and wanting a better future for yourself and future generations (or supporting what he supports from afar). If you don’t support him but still want to engage, that’s why they have askthe_donald. And that’s not to say someone who supports Trump has never been shitty, there are bad eggs in all camps. No racism is a strictly enforced rule, so pretending it should be removed for being “racist” is deliberately disingenuous.

The reason I ever found out about that sub in the first place is a common experience that unites many people who now actively lurk or participate; they were told it was a shitshow of disgusting people and they realized that it’s reality didn’t match what others had to say. People get curious, so they check it out on their own. Over time, people start to learn why it is slandered as much as it is and why establishment politicians are as threatened by Trump as they are. 

> I mean, you sound like you share some of their perspectives like a belief in the idea that ""political correctness"" and ""identity politics"" are somehow threats

They are distinctly authoritarian tools used to give more power to the state through division and instilling chaos/fear, which is antithetical to the US Constitution.

> It goes without saying that if you align enough with the beliefs of a group that they will generally treat you civilly and that otherwise they will not. 

No single person agrees 100% on anything. I’ve disagreed with people countless times civilly on that sub. Despite disparities, people are still united in supporting Trump. That doesn’t mean it’s blind worship, it’s picking your battles. That doesn’t happen in default subs, I’m either told to 1) fuck off back to the_donald 2) shadowbanned 3) banned or 4) followed and harassed via PM after a slurry of ad hominems.

>  Why do your anecdotes regarding the civility and decency of that subreddit trump the anecdotes of users who claim the opposite? 

I am speaking from experience of actively participating there while others are speaking from what others have told them it is. Most people don’t like to go against the grain and fight for what they believe in, they’d rather follow the crowd so as to not be socially ostracized.

> Why should I believe you over many other users?

Why believe someone who has been active there for years vs. someone who is informed second or third hand? Do you trust a restaurant review from people who’ve never been but have just heard about it more than people that frequent it? What you choose to believe is your prerogative, but the logical answer is glaringly simple. Peruse it yourself. You don’t have to agree with their general views to realize that it’s not a bastion of hatred, racism, sexism, etc. it’s falsely accused of being.

While I see your point (and do agree that Trumpet blocking the investigation is atrocious) an ongoing investigation implies that the case has merit. 
In this case, it's better to block the investigation, than to have an FBI inquiry legitimise the case. Politically speaking of course.

If we break it down,  we have a case where 10% is actual substance, and 90% smoke and mirrors. Politics at its finest. The substance of the case is a he said she said situation thirty odd years ago. I guess that what really happened really is the two of them were fooling around, and if you squint really hard, that kinda maybe can be read as an assault.
The timing, the push and pushback around the investigation, all of that is just for the goal that midterms are coming.

One of them claimed that it's an economic issue and that we should admit anyone in this country because ""they're just trying to make money and support their families"" while the other braindead dipshit had a strong stance that we should let everyone come in because it's basic human right.

>>I couldn't fucking stand it anymore.

>I asked them both, so that everyone present could hear me, if the immigrants want to have strong economy and basic human rights then why don't they work and achieve them in their respective countries of origin instead of coming here?

>Now the entire company is incoherently yelling at me and I'm laughing at them. They want me to fucking apologize for saying that. I think I'm gonna get fired.

>EDIT:I actually managed to make the situation worse. By a lot. Everything pretty much died down when some guys from upper management appeared to see what the ruckus is about, I came forward and explained the situation and I was asked (again) to apologize for saying that and hurting their feelings. And so I did, I apologized. I apologized by saying that I'm deeply sorry that Andrew and Ethan got their feelings hurt by my remarks about immigration and that if they love diversity and multiculturalism that much I will be more than happy to financially support their effort in immigrating from America to Zimbabwe where everyone is diverse and non privileged. Shit was bad. Now it got hysterical. I'm so getting fired, that part is not fun. But I still can't stop fucking laughing. I think I'm losing it.

>EDIT 2 :I escalated the situation to the point where some of the female colleagues started crying. One of the managers told me he's giving me one more chance to remedy the situation by declaring myself as a non Trump supporter and to find the way to make Andrew and Ethan not angry with me. I told everyone at the office that I have perfect people just for that. Their names are Pajeet and Rasheed, the Indian Java developers who can't tell a difference between a class and a method and they can't really grasp the concepts of polymorphism and encapsulation, but that's perfectly fine because they're non white and that Andrew and Ethan can spend some time checking their privilege while diverse people do their job for 10% of their pay. I also told them that rejecting Rasheed and Pajeet would be illegal because they're Israel's exports. And as far as Trump goes I told them I never actually supported the guy, I was just forced into voting for him because I don't think a woman that drinks blood of dead kids she raped with her witch friends and supports her rapist husband should have any say where our military should fight and start wars. The office is almost dead silent now. You can hear occasional sobbing.

**Allowing people like t_d users to spread misinformation and radicalize people with impunity normalizes that behavior.** No, prohibiting that behavior is not worse than simply allowing it - banning/quarantining that sort of shit results in fewer eyes upon it, and therefore fewer people potentially being radicalized.

I mean that there is a moral panic insinuated for political gain around the #MeToo movement that is being overblown to get clicks and sell papers but that journalists poise a greater long-term risk to cohesion of the nation with their breeding of mistrust, hatred, division and lies.

That isn't a tacit endorsement of paedophilia, but a lament that journalists don't have the same bad reputation that paedophiles have when they completely deserve it.

6836,"Your argument can be sustained on the moral plane, even though I personally disagree with it, being a more utilitarian thinker.

Where it falls flat is on the practical plane. In short, it suffers the same problems socialism as a doctrine does, a belief in the ""goodness"" of man. This is understandable as both ideas stem from Rousseau's own theory of the social contract, in that it is society that corrupts man.

>Especially for outliers, I think it will be far more civil. Generally, I do think it will ultimately be less violent and more liberal than the current system.

This part here is especially problematic. If you re-read both my previous posts, humanity has been in a state of anarchy for far longer than it has been in a state of ordered society. Violence was far more common the less societies were organized. 

Your non-aggression principle is, in essence, no different than laws. Most people know, both on a legal and moral basis, that they should not kill or harm others. Yet, many do it anyway for a variety of motives. The idea of applying that universal principle to everyone without an effective enforcement mechanism is utopian at best.

> It is natural order

That seems to me like an appeal to nature. Because something is closer to an imagined original state of being does not make it more correct.

>Pruning solutions that require forced compliance and funding leaves voluntary solutions, many of which I’d argue are also superior in terms of efficacy, cost, accountability to stakeholders, etc.

I'm going to address this and the gist of your anti-establishment argument along two lines:

1- Most of your proposed benefits base themselves on a presupposition of the inviolability of private property. Yet without an overarching structure to protect that private property, it is down to whatever capacity you have to defend it that preserves it. 

Where in the world there is least enforcement and state presence, property (and life) is in an incredibly precarious position. Historical evidence from the first recorded histories to the modern days supports this. From the endemic violence of the prehistoric era to the warlords of Afghanistan, the more tenuous the state's grasp on the monopoly of violence, the more widespread that violence is.

2- You also assume these solutions would be more efficient and better (this is what I assume by you using ""superior""). However, if we look at the Healthcare industry in the US, which is reasonably deregulated, healthcare cartels drive up costs and there is notable collusion between various agencies in that system that result in a lack of access and the driving up of costs for the consumers. Add to that the fact that despite the overwhelming privatization, the government is still spending a stupid amount on healthcare per person, most of it going to hospital and insurance companies without appreciable gains for the consumer.

Meanwhile, most of the better performing and accessible healthcare systems are single payer socialized systems. 

Without regulatory agencies, there is nothing to prevent monopolies on essential goods, resulting in a loss of efficiency. And we're not even getting into externalities (ie: pollution).

----------------------------

In sum, when evaluating any proposed political system, I find it always useful to use [Rawl's Veil of Ignorance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veil_of_ignorance).

Would you be ready to be born in your system as a manual laborer whose home can at any time be ransacked by bandits, or who can be waylaid on the roads (who's building those by the way?) at any time, as frequently happened in lawless areas throughout history?

Are you also ready to forgo most of the comforts of modern life because you can't afford them, because the cost of setting up shop has gone drastically up due to security costs?

What about the internet? Might as well forget about net neutrality now that ISPs have no regulatory agencies above them.

And so it goes.

**I'd be remiss if I didn't mention you still haven't answered my question.** You do not propose an alternative to the current system apart from mentioning what should be taken out of it. Yet you don't mention what you want to replace them by, and how, which was the core of my question.

Are you advocating for the destruction of countries, as in disregarding borders and seeing each individual as a sovereign entity? Are you arguing for a commune based lifestyle in which people freely associate or leave? Are for a broad federation of interests in which limited enforcement exists?

**It's easy to be against things, it's harder to create solutions.**

All of those alternatives (and more) can be argued from an anarchist standpoint, but what I've found when discussing with anarcho-communists or libertarians is that they're very light on details when it comes to the nitty gritty stuff of ""how it works"". This is something you do in this passage:

>Some institutions may look capitalist (market-based) or socialist (voluntary pooled risk/resources.) Most anarchists favor one or the other to the exclusion of the other. I tend to favor market systems, but have no inherent objection to voluntary socialism or communism.

It again refers to my initial problem with your line of thinking. It stems from a presupposition that the rest of humanity is able or willing to follow your own ethics. The same as socialism, the entire thing falls apart as soon as someone doesn't play ball and is able to organize other humans into taking your stuff (and subjugating you).",1,e6wdthb,BionicTransWomyn,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7f8df2ea2cd0>,t1_e6wbrun,1538295560

Any time, and I do mean *any* time, you offer a situation in which speech isn't protected it *will* be abused by censors. 

Copy rights are abused to squash criticism all the time. People are saying that misgendering or dead naming a trans person is akin to a direct call to violence because it paints a target on their back. I mean, fuck, I remember a video where a cop tried to intimidate a person filming by saying him vocally telling a person being questioned that they didn't have to comply was inciting a riot. 

That's why we have rights. To limit the abuse of power. And if we're *really* going to set the precedent that an incendiary conspiracy theories aren't protected because they're akin to yelling fire in a theater, how the fuck would watergate of been a thing? Oh, but watergate is true and all that joo stuff is fake? Well I bet Trump can find a lot of people to tell you all this Russia shit is a lie before he starts rounding up journos.

It's not a strong crypto-anarchy, but from the perspective of the user-base it is quite similar especially as it relates to this property:

> A crypto-anarchy [is] a community where the threat of violence is impotent because violence is impossible, and violence is impossible because its participants cannot be linked to their true names or physical locations.

Knowing someones physical identity is a necessary precursor to violence.

Rigorous and focused enforcement of doxing rules and user education/tools are the necessary, best approach to prevent violence from arising from reddit.


> Should they allow communities where you can hire someone for murder?

No, see dox rule.

> What about child porn?

No, the government would shut the site down.

> What if certain subs are recruiting grounds for radical muslims or white supremacists or violent gangs?

Violent gangs like r/protectandserve and r/fullcommunism?  I don't think we should play favorites.  Their capacity for actual violence via reddit is tempered to the extent that reddit remains anonymous.

> What about a sub with the main purpose of doxxing random people just to make their lives miserable?

The U.S is a major super power that has both immense economic and military influence on the world stage and it is unabashedly capitalist. Its economic, military and political interests are all hopelessly entangled and because of that America's maneuvers are capitalism in action outside the vacuum of the perfect world of theory. They are the biggest most powerful boosters of capitalist ideology and as such are the primary example. However, the problems of a capitalist system don't simply manifest in America and there are plenty examples of other nations using violence in favour of capitalist interests, and you'd be hard pressed to find any nation on Earth that hasn't committed crimes to serve capitalist interests. Here in Canada the treatment of indigenous pipeline protesters is a prime example.

7096,"""... want to hear from someone who has been active there for over two years rather than melodramatic, and often fabricated, hackneyed insults from people who do not visit that sub unless they’re expressly looking for something to reinforce their current worldview. ""  


So everyone who doesn't believe you is merely popping in once and a while to get dirt and get out? Could it not be the case that people lurk there and simply watch the exchanges occur? That those users could have been on there since the sub's inception?  


""Hours old accounts posting hateful content and taking a screenshot of it isn’t an example of it organically promoting hate. ""  


What is organically promoting hate supposed to mean? Does the sub itself have to clearly state that it supports hate? Have you looked at all the screenshots? All the discussions regarding the conduct of T\_D? How much energy or effort have you put into examining what other subs or even journalists have written about T\_D? How many hours old does an account have to be or how long does that user have to be involved with T\_D to count towards the organic hate meter?   


""Literally everyone is welcome to support Trump. There is no discrimination in being proud to be an American and wanting a better future for yourself and future generations (or supporting what he supports from afar).""  


That statement adds nothing to your argument. There can be plenty of discrimination in being ""proud"" of ones nation depending on how that pride manifests materially. The community of T\_D are ""patriots"" who want a ""better"" future and therefore don't discriminate is just an empty sentiment and a useless bit of circular logic.  


""No racism is a strictly enforced rule, so pretending it should be removed for being “racist” is deliberately disingenuous.""     


They have a rule that racism is not allowed so it doesn't happen. Kind of like how making being a criminal a crime will eradicate crime, eh? Disingenuous is stating that something isn't a problem simply because there is a rule that prevents it from being a problem. Although this does make me wonder what you think discrimination and racism are.  


""... they were told it was a shitshow of disgusting people and they realized that it’s reality didn’t match what others had to say. People get curious, so they check it out on their own. Over time, people start to learn why it is slandered as much as it is and why establishment politicians are as threatened by Trump as they are.""  


I'll grant you that the way people often present their perspective on T\_D in a hyperbolic way, but that doesn't mean that the evidence and claims journalists and reddit users have made are false. It also hasn't been established that T\_D is slandered at all. That is what you are claiming is true from your perspective. Claiming that establishment politicians are threatened by Trump is also irrelevant to the discussion regarding the conduct of T\_D and is simply an opinion that isn't fact.  


""They are distinctly authoritarian tools used to give more power to the state through division and instilling chaos/fear, which is antithetical to the US Constitution.""  


By what mechanism? Who are the perpetrators? I'm from a progressive left position and when we see the words ""political correctness"" or ""identity politics"" they are generally bully terms used to silence voices airing legitimate concerns. They are often used to crush opposition from minorities when they try to challenge established discriminatory practices. They are an old trick in the right play book of smears.  


""No single person agrees 100% on anything. I’ve disagreed with people countless times civilly on that sub. Despite disparities, people are still united in supporting Trump. That doesn’t mean it’s blind worship, it’s picking your battles. That doesn’t happen in default subs, I’m either told to 1) fuck off back to the\_donald 2) shadowbanned 3) banned or 4) followed and harassed via PM after a slurry of ad hominems.""  


Funny, I've had the same experiences when members of T\_D brigade more left subs. Save the banning of course, but the pm harassment is spot on. Civilly disagreeing with someone when you believe in the core tenants of a community is easy. After all, you do believe that ""There is no discrimination in being proud to be an American and wanting a better future for yourself and future generations..."". Did it occur to you that you have such a rosy picture of T\_D because you are their target user?  


""Most people don’t like to go against the grain and fight for what they believe in, they’d rather follow the crowd so as to not be socially ostracized.""  


Supporting Trump is not going against the grain. Try fighting for a worker's right to organize in a country where the word ""socialism"" is considered an evil buzzword by people who really don't know anything about. That is going against the grain. Again though, not relevant to this discussion.  


""Why believe someone who has been active there for years vs. someone who is informed second or third hand? Do you trust a restaurant review from people who’ve never been but have just heard about it more than people that frequent it? What you choose to believe is your prerogative, but the logical answer is glaringly simple. Peruse it yourself.""  


I do lurk there and I do agree that there are many problems with that community. Largely because the members don't understand what ""political correctness"", ""identity politics"" or racism actually entail. In the end, you and I are not going to agree here because we don't share the same political lexicon.

I would say that *very* few people or subs I see on reddit are overly misandrist or misogynistic (there are a few explicity or near explicitly misogynistic subs whereas I know of zero explicitly misandrist ones), but a number of them are perpetrators of ""unintentional"" or more subtle forms of it: Feminism as a movement is very good at pointing out how there's a lot of subtle misogyny in society and in social norms and in people's sterotypes, for example: I'd say the same sort of stuff is very common towards men as well... unfortunately, I often see it coming out of the very same places who point it out when it happens to women, and vis versa: Mens Right's subs often make sexist generalizations about women, and I see a lot of what would be described as social justice subs doing it towards men.

I'm really interested in this sort of topic personally, but I've found it impossible to really become a regular poster on any of these subs because I find most of them hypocritical and lacking self awareness of how they are doing the same sorts of things they are criticizing others for, and then use the same justifications to try to defend it with ""no, it's different because...""

The UMAP camps served as a form of alternative civilian service for Cubans who could not serve in the military due to being, **conscientious objectors, Christians and other religious people, homosexuals, or political enemies of Fidel Castro or his communist revolution.** The majority of UMAP servicemen were **conscientious objectors.** A small portion or about 8% to 9% of the inmates were **homosexual men, Jehovah's Witnesses, Seventh-day Adventists, Catholic priests and Protestant ministers, intellectuals, farmers who resisted collectivization, as well as anyone else considered ""anti-social"" or ""counter-revolutionary"".** Former Intelligence Directorate agent Norberto Fuentes estimated that of approximately 35,000 internees, **507 ended up in psychiatric wards, 72 died from torture, and 180 committed suicide.** A 1967 human rights report from the Organization of American States found that over 30,000 internees are ""forced to work for free in state farms from 10 to 12 hours a day, from sunrise to sunset, seven days per week, poor alimentation with rice and spoiled food, unhealthy water, unclean plates, congested barracks, no electricity, latrines, no showers, inmates are given the same treatment as political prisoners.""

>but you could also argue all day about the Holocaust, and they will try and throw ""facts"" at you

I could not argue about the Holocaust. I would never do that. Because there exists very clear and explicit evidence that it was a deliberate and systematic campaign for ethnic cleansing.

On the other hand, there exists no evidence of a deliberate famine (because that's fucking ridiculous, the technology to bribe the clouds not to rain just didn't exist back then), kulaks were a class and not an ethnic group, and plenty of evidence exists that the kulaks burned their grain, killing themselves and many others.

>Not all bourgeoisie are evil

I don't care if they are good or evil. They do 0% of the work, take 100% of the profits and return a tiny percentage back to the people do produced the thing they sold. That's exploitation, by definition. If people demand more or simply organize to opt out, they repress them brutally. Not because they are inherent bad people, but because capitalism requires them to do this or to stop being a part of the bourgeoisie, simple as that.

>You claim you are different because when you consider violence ""its not arbitrary"", you claim violence is ""justified and necessary"" - Nazis will do the same thing; they claim that minorities are evil, that killing them is justified because it will make society better. You dont call for violence, but you do say ""violence is justified and necessary"" and would want people to consider it as a option. When Nazis argue for the genocide of  nonwhites, or leftists, or homosexuals, they will also ""not advocate violence"", but claim that its ""justified and necessary"" and try and push people towards those ideas. If we are censoring Nazis for this, then we should censor Communists for this too.

If you think that Nazis ""do the same thing"" then you are either a Nazi sympathizer or just *drowning* in the koolaid of ideology. When the Allies mobilized violently against the Nazis, this was not ""the same"" as when the Nazis carried out genocide. When the USSR defeated the Nazis--violently--this was not ""the same"" as the Holocaust. And when communists support stopping capitalism's ongoing genocides, this is not ""the same"" as the opportunism of fascism when it directs violence against scapegoats.

In fact, that's something that could be said about literally anything (including allowing such actions - which is what has been the case for the past two years and we've seen the situation escalate dramatically since the election), so unless you can show that what you said is guaranteed to be the case here, you need to find a better argument, especially when your proposed solution is no longer viable.

There's two problems with what you've said here.  The first one is that it's difficult to examine the damage of specific instances of censorship, *because of the censorship*.  It is an opportunity cost, not a tangible value.  We know of the damage because we have statistical data from societies and cultures that practice it versus those that value free speech, and we know the types of people it targets because we can see which people complain about being censored.

The other error is your last sentence where you claim my proposed solution is no longer viable.  My proposed solution is absolutely still viable.  Do not quarantine communities, and do not remove posts.  That is totally within reddit's capabilities.

> Allowing people like t_d users to spread misinformation and radicalize people with impunity normalizes that behavior.

That is true, which is why free speech is so important.  If you were allowed to respond to and rebuff their nonsense at every turn, they would be forced to engage with you, or at least have your argument continually thrown at them.  When you censor them, you force them to create their own community and isolate themselves and strengthen their echo chamber even further.  By not being able to refute them, you rob yourself of the possibility to change their mind, and ensure that their behavior and beliefs do not change.

> This isn't quashing dissent, this isn't persecuting people for having different opinions, this isn't ""le libtard leftists censoring muh free speech"" - this is preventing extremists from radicalizing others to bolster their numbers. Giving them a platform with which to spread their propaganda.

You are wrong.  The answer to bad ideas spreading is to refute them.  Blocking them from being spoken does not change their mind, and it robs the rest of the world the ability to hear their *and your* views, and decide for themselves which arguments are sound.

In short, the censor proclaims himself the moral authority to be the arbiter of what is acceptable thought and what is not.  You may find that appropriate when you find the thoughts of places like t_d to be so repugnant, but it is not appropriate.  It is not your, nor anybody's, moral right to decide what views other people are allowed to consider.  By censoring them, you not only entrench them and deny the ability to change them, you also declare yourself the moral authority on thought -- you declare that it is your right to decide what speech other people can hear.  And that simply is not your right.

> If this were about censoring free speech, then subs like /r/conservative and /r/libertarian would've been quarantined/banned as well, but they weren't, because they aren't bigoted cesspools like t_d or the subs that the reddit admins actually take action against - and I'm saying that as a gigantic liberal SJW socialist cuck.

7279,"**Veil of ignorance**

The ""veil of ignorance"" is a method of determining the morality of political issues proposed in 1971 by American philosopher John Rawls in his ""original position"" political philosophy. It is based upon the following thought experiment: people making political decisions imagine that they know nothing about the particular talents, abilities, tastes, social class, and positions they will have within a social order. When such parties are selecting the principles for distribution of rights, positions, and resources in the society in which they will live, this ""veil of ignorance"" prevents them from knowing who will receive a given distribution of rights, positions, and resources in that society. For example, for a proposed society in which 50% of the population is kept in slavery, it follows that on entering the new society there is a 50% likelihood that the participant would be a slave.

Since your argument is the sub as a whole is banworthy (not individual user activity which is tightly policed), why don't you go on the front page, or hell, anywhere on the first ten pages, right now, and link me to something you consider sitewide banworthy. Certainly you would consider that a better test of whether the sub, as a whole, should be banned, considering front page posts much more accurately reflect the opinions of the sub than a few isolated user posts. Since everybody here outside T_D has such a boner for banning T_D and is SO certain it should be banned it should be extremely easy to find an egregious example. Go ahead, I'll wait.

Non-liars ask for *their own, and the liars',* statements to be *investigated*. ""What proof is there?"" ""What backs this idea up?"" Liars are very much against their statements being looked into.

For a relevant example, whenever a Democratic politician is accused of sex abuse, the Democrats and Republicans both want the matter investigated and if proven, prosecuted. Whenever a Republican politician is accused of sex abuse, the Democrats want the matter investigated and prosecuted, and the Republicans attack the accuser, downplay it, and want it all covered up.

That's how liars operate: their ethics are asymmetrical. One rule for themselves, one rule for others. Non-liars, people of integrity, apply the *same* rule to themselves as to others.

FB hasn't changed the way that I relate to my extended family (or anyone else, for that matter). It just changed, within my control, the extent to which I'm exposed to them.

If you saw your uncles in person with the same frequency that you saw them on Facebook, you probably would've noticed the same political talk & felt the same need to respond. Your relationship with them would change the same way that your relationship with your best friend would change if you got an apartment together--it's not a ""Facebook"" thing, it's an overexposure thing.

I'll use a (pre-FB) example.

I have an aunt & uncle who I saw **maybe** once per year, max, for no longer than a couple of hours. I had no idea what they thought about anything, as I didn't really know them.

Then, one summer, I went to stay with them for over a month. I learned what they thought about everything, because I was around them a lot more.

Adding someone on Facebook is like being around them constantly. They don't change, I don't change, the dynamic between us doesn't change. All that changes is that, now, I'm there to hear whatever they have to say, whereas before, I wasn't.

If I decide I no longer want to be around them constantly, there are unfriend/unfollow/turn off messages/block buttons.

It's not a direct call to violence. It does increase the likelihood of a violent act for no reason. As I've said elsewhere, I'd love to live in a society where we didn't have to have these conversations, where everyone just understood that it's pretty easy to make small but meaningful efforts to not antagonize each other. But that is not a vision which conservatives share. And because they insist not just that they be permitted by law to antagonize whoever they want without regard for the consequences, but that the rest of us must not even ask them to stop, well, now we have to talk about censorship and free speech.

>why

Because I'm bored, I'll go ahead and pretend that you're asking this in good faith even though your username makes it very clear that you aren't. The answer is that no one likes to admit that their entire worldview is wrong. And at this point, these people have constructed an entire worldview out of shit like InfoWars and NaturalNews and Gateway Pundit. (I say ""these people"" but I'm aware there's a reasonably good chance you're one of them.) Admitting you have been wrong, not about one thing or two things but about everything, is *extremely* hard for any person to do. Admitting that you have catastrophically failed to understand the world is extremely hard for any person to do. And a person is only going to be able to do it under extraordinary circumstances, the threshold for which will vary from person to person. But that threshold is not reachable when the network of lies remains constant.

Perhaps if you could get these people out of their InfoWars bubble and detox them for a week, you'd have a shot. But you can't do that. Any voice that disagrees with their narrative is drowned out by the voices that affirm it.

7471,"> how about just letting people come to their own conclusions and trusting things to work out. it only worked for, oh, 240 years. 

Did it, though? Let's map out those years on one issue as an example. We could map it out on many issues, but let's just pick one to start with. From 1788, the year the U.S. Constitution went into effect, to 1865, black people were considered 3/5 of a person and could legally be owned. It was not ""letting people come to their own conclusions"" that ended chattel slavery in America. It was a civil war. Even if you're one of those kooks that claims the American Civil War was fought over some other issue, you surely will stipulate that the precipitating event for the end of slavery was, in fact, the war. It was not the result of a societal debate.

Then, for the next couple of decades, the people who believed in racial equality tried to effectuate it via legislation, regulation, and rational argument, while those who did not believe in it waged a campaign of racialized terrorism until finally they battered their opponents into submission. They were aided in this by the fact that ""the crowd"" continued to believe that black people were inferior. Those who believed in racial equality were actually a very small minority among whites, even in the North.

Then, for 80 or 90 years, black people lived as second-class citizens. In large swaths of the country, they were functionally denied the right to vote, to own property, to start a business. There is a great deal of scholarship on this, and I'll assume you're aware of the history of Jim Crow. Now black people, and a few white people, made impassioned pleas over this period of time to the effect that segregation was wrong and that all people should be treated equally before the law. But for nearly a century, their arguments failed to persuade ""the crowd."" In fact, when segregation was officially outlawed by the Supreme Court, and then further legislated against by Congress and the President, there was still not a clear majority of the electorate in favor of integration. White people famously reacted with violence and riots, and not just in the South. That's ""the crowd"" again.

Now you might argue that, eventually, ""the crowd"" got it right. Eventually, ""the crowd"" sorted out right from wrong on this issue. But in the interim, there was a great deal of real human suffering. That might be hard for you to empathize with, but I think you ought to try anyway.

When we talk about political disagreements, or disagreements over the facts, we are not talking about trivial matters. Politics is not trivial. Politics is life and death. Everything that a political body does is a matter of life and death. That doesn't mean we should legislate acceptable opinions. But we must see the spread of disinformation for what it is.

7475,"> Spend some time honestly investigating why people vote for Trump. Steelman their arguments. 

I live in Kansas. I have no shortage of people willing--very willing--to talk about why they vote the way they do. I get about an even mix of two sets of responses. The first is from people who are so close to incoherent that many of my Facebook friends actually think they're not real people and are just some troll job designed to make fun of Trump voters, but they're not. They really exist. And what they say is just a toxic slurry of disinformation willfully spread by those with a known agenda.

The second group are quite coherent and intelligible, but much of what they say--like much of what Trump says--is predicated on demonstrably false things. I'm actually not confused at all by those who voted for Donald Trump. I've never really been confused by those who vote Republican. I've spent most of my life amongst them. Voting for Donald Trump was not a meaningfully different act than voting for any other Republican. It was motivated by the same things that any vote for any Republican is likely to be motivated by. Republicans spent a lot of time--some still do spend a lot of time--performing shock and dismay that their party was ""taken over"" by Donald Trump, but he's just a culmination of what they've been for close to a century now. There was no great movement of Obama voters into Trump's camp, despite the popular narrative. The real data shows you that there was a meaningful chunk of Obama voters who *stayed home*, not who voted for Trump.

People vote for Republicans because they believe in the Republican program. Donald Trump was simply a purer and more honest expression of what that ideology actually stands for than any we've previously seen elevated to that level. He rightly intuited that the Republican base was never really interested in globalization or free trade. He saw that what had always motivated them was an anxiety about--as some of them have loudly explained since his election--being ""replaced,"" losing their position as the default mode of society. What had always motivated them was a suspicion that someone out there was getting one over on them, was getting something that wasn't deserved, was cheating the system. And they didn't necessarily have any great moral objection to that, but they didn't like that it was someone else instead of them. They don't mind government handouts, not at all--but they want to be the only ones who get them.

Donald Trump understood what had always motivated a certain kind of person in this country because he was such a person. And because he was perhaps the only man of wealth who had never been allowed into the truly elite spaces of upper-crust society, he had never deluded himself into thinking he was better than them. Instead, he had prided himself on being as vulgar and crass and terrible as the lowest common denominator. He was the people's billionaire. *Of course* they fucking voted for him. They were always going to vote for him.

The question is, why are there so many of them? Why are there more of them now than there were just a couple decades ago? Could it have some connection to the rise of a cable news network and a host of right-wing radio shows that are unashamedly devoted to delegitimizing the mainstream press and muddying the waters of what's true, therefore making it much easier for people to retreat into their pre-existing biases? And isn't it noteworthy that this network, and these radio shows, proliferated *immediately* after the elimination of the Fairness Doctrine, the deregulation of media conglomerations, and the rollback of various other measures designed to combat the spread of misinformation in mass media, even though they unarguably were also infringements on absolute free speech?

7513,"> So everyone who doesn't believe you is merely popping in once and a while to get dirt and get out

I didn’t make that claim. I said that the majority of people who have the iconic “it promotes hate speech” view (the standard ‘racist, sexist, homophobic, fascist, etc.’ claims) don’t actually have their own experience there and have unwittingly adopted that interpretation from others who’ve been deliberately disingenuous about what it is for ulterior political motives. And many who do go there with false preexisting beliefs seek out behavior they believe is common, when it’s actually not.

> What is organically promoting hate supposed to mean?

Seeing it commonly rather than an anomaly. A central rule rather than an exception. Something that seems to unite people there, when in reality the opposite is what unites people there. Love and respect for uniquely American (western) ideologies and values and strong contempt for postmodern, Marxist, and likeminded ideologies whose undergirding principle is rooted in division and master/slave or oppressor/oppressed dialectics.

> That statement adds nothing to your argument

Except people falsely call it a place that promotes bigotry. In reality, anyone is welcome to share their support.

> They have a rule that racism is not allowed so it doesn't happen. Kind of like how making being a criminal a crime will eradicate crime, eh

That’s why I said there are bad eggs in every group. A rule doesn’t eliminate the possibility, but the overwhelming majority of cases where there is an offending post, it’s by a burner account or someone who openly admits they want to “earn their ban”. By your logic, then, every subreddit would be subject to being shut down due to people breaking rules. Doesn’t make much sense to ban an entire community based on the bad actions of a few.

> It also hasn't been established that T_D is slandered at all. That is what you are claiming is true from your perspective. 

There are chrome extensions for the expressed purpose of identifying people who’ve posted there. They are removed from the front page. Spez admitted to editing comments. If you make a post there you are automatically banned from several subreddits whether or not you’ve participated in them or even heard of them. Any time you post in a default sub, you’re accused of brigading. I am banned from default news subs for no reason (because I voiced dissent), and when I inquire why I was banned I am muted by the mods. Literally almost *any* time I ever post anywhere, there are at least 2 or 3 people that complain about post history just to participate in the anti-Trump circlejerk. 

>  I'm from a progressive left position and when we see the words ""political correctness"" or ""identity politics"" they are generally bully terms used to silence voices airing legitimate concerns. They are often used to crush opposition from minorities when they try to challenge established discriminatory practices. They are an old trick in the right play book of smears.

Political correctness is disguising censorship as morality for political gain. Identity politics is deliberately segmenting the population and unnecessarily turning certain groups against others for the purposes of inciting chaos and fear for political gain. Authoritarianism is explicitly extreme leftist ideology while the extreme right is libertarian and ultimately anarchy. Neither extreme are good, but people pretending that the far-right is “fascist” is ignorant. Likewise, considering censorship and identity politics as a tool of the right who deeply covets the concept of inalienable liberty, forbearance rights/autonomy, and limited state is deeply ignorant.

>  Did it occur to you that you have such a rosy picture of T_D because you are their target user?

There is no target user, and I lurked there long before I ever participated. I found the sub because they were at the top of all talking about sound dampeners being installed at the DNC convention and Bernie protestors being fenced out. Ask other redditors with integrity, people remember default politics subs being organically anti-Hillary and overwhelmingly pro-Bernie until it basically flipped overnight. Why is that? Some of the most active people in the_donald are ex-Bernie supporters who have been forced out of default subs because anything short of shilling for Hillary seems you a neo-Nazi. 

> Supporting Trump is not going against the grain. Try fighting for a worker's right to organize in a country where the word ""socialism"" is considered an evil buzzword by people who really don't know anything about. That is going against the grain. Again though, not relevant to this discussion.

The left likes to pretend that people who despise the concept of socialism are all uneducated rednecks whose concept of socialism is borne out of Glen Beck commentary. In reality, socialism is fiercely rejected by many who have studied incalculable examples of it leading to murderous, disgusting totalitarian regimes that have left some of the darkest stains on human history. The left likes to pretend somehow that Nazi Germany was “far right” when in reality the party gained its initial support specifically because it included socialist in its name for the purposes of being deceptively alluring. Not because it was socialist or because Hitler was a socialist, he later publicly said he despised socialism, but used it because it gave him a stronger base that later perverted itself into the travesty it became. Not a single socialist country has ever been successful, and that includes the overwhelmingly white European democratic socialist countries people like to tout as examples whose defense is largely paid by the US taxpayer. Socialism is not evil in and of itself, it’s a tool used by the corrupt to gain more power under the nebulous concept of “the common good”.

> I do lurk there and I do agree that there are many problems with that community. Largely because the members don't understand what ""political correctness"", ""identity politics"" or racism actually entail. In the end, you and I are not going to agree here because we don't share the same political lexicon.

Let’s assume your claim is valid, so you’re arguing they should be banned because some people have misused definitions in your view? Ignoring the fact that you seem to be the one who is confused about the actual definitions of those terms, if you are honest with yourself you would take issue with the vitriol in all political subs, not just ones that you personally disagree with. The amount of seething hatred and groupthink in default subs is notoriously toxic and if you can’t find issue with that then you might consider that you don’t actually care about promoting a safer environment, but really you are fine with the practice of silencing others with whom you disagree. Aka, complicit in censorship and being a political pawn for tech conglomerates working at the behest of corrupt politicians while mindlessly LARPing as an intellectual egalitarian anti-capitalist.

If you can get people to believe that whiteness is a moral good then you can get them to believe that they are threatened by diversity and integration.

That's the end goal: dividing people, inciting violence and sustaining white supremacy. You don't want to end oppression because you know an end to oppression means peace and integration and an end to whiteness as a dominating social force.

Even in the deep south in the height of discrimination, there were usually a couple of shops/restaurants that would begrudgingly serve black people through the back door (frankly they had bigger concerns walking around town than where to eat). However, in principle, there was nothing stopping a community from completely discriminating against certain types of people, and this is a basic part of the argument for the Civil Rights Act.

>The fact that conservatism at large isn't banned on reddit is not remotely some kind of proof that reddit doesn't engage in censorship.

Are you aware that there is a huge fundamental difference between shutting down a subreddit because its users routinely break the rules of the site, and censoring someone purely for their opinions?

reddit **is** banning subs whose users routinely break the rules of the site & the laws of the land (everything from doxxing and brigading to death threats) and the mods do **nothing**.

Your claim (and the claim of so many other conservatives and libertarians) is that reddit is censoring anyone who isn't a leftist, socialist, liberal, democrat, marxist, or any other label typically associated with anyone left of center. The fact that they allow subs that dissent so long as they remain respectful of the site's rules (which is a pretty reasonable expectation), proves that claim false.


>The answer to bad ideas spreading is to refute them. Blocking them from being spoken does not change their mind, and it robs the rest of the world the ability to hear their and your views, and decide for themselves which arguments are sound.

You can't argue with people in a bubble, you just can't. If I were to go to t_d and they were to allow me to try to refute the claims there, I would get downvoted to hell, and my comment would be buried under so much shit that the only t_d users who would see it would be people actively searching for dissenters to further ridicule them. The same goes for left-leaning subs like /r/latestagecapitalism - even though I'm pretty close to considering myself a socialist, I don't participate in that sub or even regularly browse it. It's not a sub for healthy debate, and if it were ever to devolve into a radical cesspit of death threats and doxxing like t_d or the subs that reddit admins actually take action against, I would be in favor of it's removal/quarantine.

These subs actively quash dissent, making it impossible to refute anything in them. Only middleground subs that don't have any specific affiliations do you ever see actual conversations about politics that go beyond ""FUCKING LIBTARD CUCKS"" and ""EAT THE 1%""

>You may find that appropriate when you find the thoughts of places like t_d to be so repugnant, but it is not appropriate. It is not your, nor anybody's, moral right to decide what views other people are allowed to consider.

Banning rulebreakers =/= censoring free speech. If Jim Bob doesn't like black people, then he's a bigot, but he's entitled to his opinion. If Jim Bob decides to start assaulting black people, that's no longer free speech.

7653,"I remember reading that study back in February. It's even in my browser history.

A few things about that study:

1. While it looks well-sourced, there are a few places where sources aren't provided, yet arguments are build on top of them. For example, in page 4 there is a sentence, ""It is clearly the case that racial, ethnic, and homophobic hate speech have well-documented connections to violence and discrimination in the real world."". There's no citation on this claim. It's then followed by, ""Nonetheless, in this context, we feel that the term “hate speech” is a more accurate description of the content of r/fatpeoplehate than milder alternatives such as “offensive speech” or “abusive language.”"" which is in the context of ""An open question is whether this definition of hate speech pertains to body characteristics such as “fatness;” the definition presents a list of such characteristics (minorities, migrants, etc), but it does not stipulate that this list is exclusive."" What's happening is they are extending the definition for the purpose of the study and batch it together. It's degrading to people with issues that are out of their control. Fatness, on the other hand, very often isn't out of person's control. They seal the deal by stating that ""In contrast, r/fatpeoplehate focuses exclusively on denigrating fat people as a group."" Since hate speech by their provided definition (later they mention in page 6 that there isn't a universally accepted definition of hate speech) implies attacking a group of people, they attribute the same attacks to fat people.


2. They focus on keyword analysis, which has an inherent weakness: you will only look for these words and not more complex things. They mention that they are aware of this issue and it ""presents a long-term challenge"". Nevertheless, this is the preferred methodology. They then tested the system on similar subreddits to obtain baseline data.

3. They then split the study into two parts: pre and post ban windows, each being 10 days long and they compared the activity levels of affected users. Initial findings showed that, ""we found no significant evidence that the observed
decrease in posting volumes of treatment (both FPH and CT) was caused by the ban (p-value≈ 0.637
for CT users, and p-value≈ 0.897 for FPH users). In other words, the decrease in treatment posting
activity in Figure 2 is closely mirrored by the control, reflecting a deeper, underlying pattern
unrelated to the ban."" In other words, the volume of comments decreased but it seems unrelated to the ban.

4. They then did a keyword analysis of users affected by the ban. ""We analyzed over 2.5 million posts by treatment CT and control CT users, and over 13 million posts by treatment FPH and control FPH users. They depict decreases of at least 80% in treatment groups. However, in order to confirm that these decreases were due to the ban and not
some underlying, site-wide decrease in hate-speech behavior, we employ a difference-in-differences analysis as a robustness check."" They know that in order to actually see the results, they'd have to scrape all of Reddit. Instead they basically compared keyword frequencies of affected and control groups. 

5. They then tracked where users, who didn't delete their accounts, went to. They concluded that usage of their chosen keywords by these users decreased by 80%

6. At the end, they say "".Though important, there are still many hate communities on Reddit that we have not explored. [...] we do not know the exact date at which a Reddit user account was abandoned, nor the exact reason behind the termination of an account. For instance, it could have been the case that a particular account was a “throwaway"" used temporarily by a user [25]. We do not account for such things in our current work [...]""

Basically, within the scope of the study (2 hate subreddits and migrant destination subreddits, a list of very specific 20-23 keywords, and a list of users of hate subreddits) they concluded that it helped. While it's a start, it's MUCH too early to claim it worked, which is what the Techcrunch article is all about. Users are much more nuanced, there are many other subreddits, that haven't been looked at (some might be set to private [speculating about it]), used language might have changed. Moreover, there are 2 other critical issues:

1. How do you know that these users were organic? The study doesn't talk about outliers that contribute significantly more than others. There always are outliers and they must be identified. What do I mean by organic? I run a PR business and I've been approached by people to help them sway specific discussions not only in Reddit but in other platforms. Very often you have a handful of users contributing the most to the conversation. Goals are different, but are not limited to inciting hate or sabotage. How do we know this isn't sabotage? I want to see a list of outliers or at least their numbers. I sense that's a key component.

2. The study doesn't talk about the total amount of new users after the ban and what kind of users are they. Since the list of subreddits in question is very limited in scope, the reality might be very different once accounted for.

All and all, I'm very skeptical about this study. I don't give a shit about definitions or people spewing hate (whatever that means). I care about the research and its implications and I care about the fuckery of extending definitions for the purpose of the study.",-2,e6t02sf,HasStupidQuestions,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7f8df27ba350>,t1_e6sve9b,1538152849

You didn't follow what I said. I haven't talked to anyone who defends him as a moral good person.

The disagreement is about what happened.  Some people say he intentionally drove into the crowd to hurt leftists.  Many point out that he probably wouldn't have known the crowd was leftists, and he likely could not see the car that was stopped in the middle of the crowd.

Furthermore, people point out that there were people attacking his car with sticks, and he appeared to brake multiple times.

Furthermore, there is a contemporaneous internet post bragging about chasing him off by brandishing a rifle.

For one, maybe that subreddits has problems beyond what we know about. Are you a mod there? Do you know the culture and what was being discussed or talked about on the reg?

Well my point is that actually it's *not* why we're at where we're at. That such men, and such spaces, have always existed. What has changed is that we refuse to stop amplifying them and giving them a prominent platform. Not that long ago, ""Nazis are bad and should be shunned"" was such a universally accepted premise that they were the obvious default bad guys in Indiana Jones movies. The Blues Brothers memorably committed vehicular assault--and maybe vehicular manslaughter, depending on how you read the final car chase segment--against American Nazis and everyone thought it was funny.

Put that in a movie now and just watch the furrowed-brow thinkpieces about the degradation of civil discourse roll in. *That* is what changed. We started being apologetic for shunning these people. We let Republicans work the refs until things got so bad even *they* were uncomfortable with it. And for every single one of these people we let back into polite society, for every impressionable young mind we allowed to be corrupted by their wickedness, a person of color got the message that America did not give a shit about them, and that voting in the election was pointless.

I have a story.

My uncle who lives in Michigan and died a few years ago had a baby with his wife when they were both quite old (relatively speaking, this was probably 50 years ago).  His wife wanted an abortion but I don't think it was available to them in the 70s.  The boy was born with Downs Syndrome and I think his wife held it against him.   

I think this really made an impression on my uncle and he was against any sort of abortion at all.  On top of being very Catholic, i think he felt that if his wife could have had an abortion he wouldn't have had his son, and that would have been a disaster because he really really loved that kid.  No fault there, the kid has turned into a really good person and a productive member of society.

He wasn't a bad guy.  Very conservative, took care of his family and dollars to donuts he would have supported Trump.

I feel like if we could get to know people and their motivations it might make more sense or at least see how they arrived at their conclusions.

And he's the one who chose to act. It's a numbers game with what's going to set off the crazies. And further, when those crazies are right we can't let people censor the information that fed their bullshit. 

This happens online all the time. Some dumb fucks go on twitter and call some person all kinds of names and issue threats, and suddenly everyone is frothing at the mouth to shut down the criticisms that egged them on. This can be applied in the real world to things varying from local political spats to mainstream talking points to Religions' terrorism and warmongers.

And I follow some of those random sources you list. InfoWars isn't really what you think of it. It's not actually that different from other right-wing talk radio in 2018, like Rush, Savage, Hannity, Levin, etc. Alex even appeared on Savage's show the week he was banned, so they're more inter-connected than you think. The MSM makes it sound like it's always trans-dimensional vampires, but that's just a style of delivery he does. The main content is news commentary. I remember him from when I was a child, so back then, he was actually doing stuff on hard conspiracy content, like the Rothschilds, Build-a-burgers, Trilaterals and CFRs, etc., you know, your dad's stuff, but he moderated a lot at sometime between 2010 and 2015 or so, since when I picked it back up and tuned in occasionally after Trump went on his show, I was surprised at how much he had actually professionalized his message. You may not want to hear that, but I grew up my entire life with conspiracy theories being fringe entertainment, at best, so sorry if it raises red flags when people actually start trying to censor and conspire against the conspiracy theorists. That's not normal.

And, no, I'm not even a conspiracy theorist. Just a right-winger rofl. Sorry for having the wrong political beliefs.

I sincerely think the real reason he was banned is that he disproportionately appeals to the millenial and zoomer demographics. Although I don't have demo data for this, I am a millenial, and a lot of his fans in the content creator community tend to skew millenial and younger, rather than older. It makes sense, since his competition's audiences are simply just going to die off sooner.

The way you're talking is so hateful and dismiss of a huge share of the population, just think of how you would feel if we were talking that way about you. It's a basic human empathy thing. You have things that you like. You wouldn't want anyone to ban them. But other people like different things. You shouldn't try to ban things you don't like either. That's not what America is. For most of our existence, the First Amendment wasn't just a suggestion, it was an ideal. An actual value we all strive towards, to live our lives that way. Tolerate people with different opinions than you, that used to be civics 101. And worst of all it's never even effective. It doesn't matter how many billions of dollars you have, you'll have to literally throw us in jail or concentration camps like the Europeans do, since otherwise humanity finds a way and all censorship eventually has workarounds. You just might slow it down a little, but you also might accelerate it when you piss a critical mass of people off. Which, by the way, you have, when you have US presidents delivering speeches about freedom of speech on the internet at his rallies.

The paradox states that if a society is tolerant without limit, its ability to be tolerant will eventually be seized or destroyed by the intolerant. Popper came to the seemingly paradoxical conclusion that in order to maintain a tolerant society, the society must be intolerant of intolerance.

Which is an obviously bullshit explanation because the harvest of 1936 was even weaker and didn't kill 7 million people.

> Ukraine has always been a net grain exporter that's where the majority of Russia had gotten its grain for decades, the grain exports slowed but for fucks sakes you cannot be so thick that you don't understand how a basic supply line works.

They literally increased the quotas Ukrainian farmers were expected to hand over in 1932 even as production slowed down. Anybody who couldn't meet these inflated quotas had to then give up **15X their quota** (obviously not possible) to avoid being put on a blacklist, which meant Soviet authorities would take literally everything they could find from your farm, would not send aid, and would shoot you if you tried trading.

> Snyder lists seven crucial policies that **applied only, or mainly, to Soviet Ukraine.** He states: ""Each of them may seem like an anodyne administrative measure, and each of them was certainly presented as such at the time, and yet each had to kill"":[55]

* From 18 November 1932 **peasants from Ukraine were required to return extra grain they had previously earned for meeting their targets**. State police and party brigades were sent into these regions to root out any food they could find.
* Two days later, a law was passed forcing peasants who could not meet their grain quotas to surrender any livestock they had.
* Eight days later, **collective farms that failed to meet their quotas were placed on ""blacklists"" in which they were forced to surrender 15 times their quota.** These farms were picked apart for any possible food by party activists. 
* **Blacklisted communes had no right to trade or to receive deliveries of any kind, and became death zones.**
* On 5 December 1932, Stalin's security chief presented the justification for terrorizing Ukrainian party officials to collect the grain. It was considered treason if anyone refused to do their part in grain requisitions for the state.
* In November 1932 Ukraine was required to provide 1/3 of the grain collection of the entire Soviet Union. As Lazar Kaganovich put it, the Soviet state would fight ""ferociously"" to fulfill the plan.
* In January 1933 **Ukraine's borders were sealed in order to prevent Ukrainian peasants from fleeing to other republics**. By the end of February 1933 approximately 190,000 Ukrainian peasants had been caught trying to flee Ukraine and were forced to return to their villages to starve.
* **The collection of grain continued even after the annual requisition target for 1932 was met in late January 1933**.[55]",3,e6t7hm2,Serial_Peacemaker,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7f8df34d0790>,t1_e6t66m4,1538158821

The Generalplan Ost (German pronunciation: [ɡenəˈʁaːlˌplaːn ˈɔst]; English: Master Plan for the East), abbreviated GPO, was the Nazi German government's plan for the genocide and ethnic cleansing on a vast scale, and colonization of Central and Eastern Europe by Germans. It was to be undertaken in territories occupied by Germany during World War II. The plan was partially realized during the war, resulting indirectly and directly in millions of deaths of ethnic Slavs by starvation, disease, or extermination through labor. But its full implementation was not considered practicable during the major military operations, and was prevented by Germany's defeat.The plan entailed the enslavement, expulsion, and mass murder of most Slavic peoples (and substantial parts of the Baltic peoples, especially Lithuanians and Latgalians) in Europe along with planned destruction of their nations, whom the 'Aryan' Nazis viewed as racially inferior. The programme operational guidelines were based on the policy of Lebensraum designed by Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party in fulfilment of the Drang nach Osten (drive to the East) ideology of German expansionism.

7912,"> Your claim (and the claim of so many other conservatives and libertarians) is that reddit is censoring anyone who isn't a leftist, socialist, liberal, democrat, marxist, or any other label typically associated with anyone left of center. The fact that they allow subs that dissent so long as they remain respectful of the site's rules (which is a pretty reasonable expectation), proves that claim false.

I have made no such claim.  I am not talking about reddit's specific types of censorship.  I am talking about the dangers of censorship generally -- ANY censorship.  Including but not limited to reddit's.

Your injecting your own politics into this discussion.  This isn't about how much censorship reddit is doing or to whom, this is my arguing any and all censorship is wrong, and why.  Yes, more of it is worse than less of it, but censorship of all kinds is wrong.  And it is incorrect to claim reddit is doing no censorship.  They are doing some -- you may view that amount as appropriate, but you can't deny that it is indeed happening.

> You can't argue with people in a bubble, you just can't. If I were to go to t_d and they were to allow me to try to refute the claims there, I would get downvoted to hell, and my comment would be buried under so much shit that the only t_d users who would see it would be people actively searching for dissenters to further ridicule them.

Yet you claim that them denying you to speak at all, or you denying them to speak, would somehow *lessen that echo chamber bubble*!?

That's my point.  Whatever negative result you get from attempting to have a discourse with them, it's just as bad or worse to have no discourse at all.  And the only way to guarantee no discourse occurs is censorship.  That's one of many reasons I claim all censorship is wrong.

> These subs actively quash dissent, making it impossible to refute anything in them.

I agree that that is the case, and I agree that it is wrong.  So why do you figure that you and reddit also quashing dissent is the solution?

> Banning rulebreakers =/= censoring free speech.

Sure it is, if the rules are rules about what is acceptable speech.

> If Jim Bob doesn't like black people, then he's a bigot, but he's entitled to his opinion. If Jim Bob decides to start assaulting black people, that's no longer free speech.

That's a true statement, but I've never seen anybody reach through my screen on reddit and assault me.  It's a computer screen, you don't have to look at it.  If there's something hurtful displayed on it, you can turn it off or look somewhere else.

> You're also neglecting the fact that subs like t_d actively push **false information** and **foreign propaganda**.

I am not at all neglecting that.  It's absolutely true and it's reprehensible.  My claim is that the proper solution to that is to publicly refute it, not prevent them from doing it.  That way, when others hear their speech, they've already heard your rebuttal and know their speech is bullshit.  By censoring them, you merely ensure that they never hear opposing views and that anybody who finds their way to them is more easy lured in and indoctrinated.  More speech is the answer to bad free speech.  Censorship is not right, nor effective.

7918,"**Ethos**

Ethos ( or US: ) is a Greek word meaning ""character"" that is used to describe the guiding beliefs or ideals that characterize a community, nation, or ideology. The Greeks also used this word to refer to the power of music to influence emotions, behaviours, and even morals. Early Greek stories of Orpheus exhibit this idea in a compelling way. The word's use in rhetoric is closely based on the Greek terminology used by Aristotle in his concept of the three artistic proofs or modes of persuasion.

**Technology**

Technology (""science of craft"", from Greek τέχνη, techne, ""art, skill, cunning of hand""; and -λογία, -logia) is first robustly defined by Jacob Bigelow in 1829 as: ""...principles, processes, and nomenclatures of the more conspicuous arts, particularly those which involve applications of science, and which may be considered useful, by promoting the benefit of society, together with the emolument [compensation ] of those who pursue them"".

Principle is a term defined current-day by Merriam-Webster as: ""a comprehensive and fundamental law, doctrine, or assumption"", ""a primary source"", ""the laws or facts of nature underlying the working of an artificial device"", ""an ingredient (such as a chemical) that exhibits or imparts a characteristic quality"".

Process is a term defined current-day by the United States Patent Laws (United States Code Title 34 - Patents) published by the United States Patent and Trade Office (USPTO) as follows: ""The term 'process' means process, art, or method, and includes a new use of a known process, machine, manufacture, composition of matter, or material.""

Nomenclature is term defined by Merriam-Webster as: ""name, designation"", ""the act or process or an instance of naming"", ""a system or set of terms or symbols especially in a particular science, discipline, or art"".

Application of Science is a term defined current-day by the United States' National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine as: ""...any use of scientific knowledge for a specific purpose, whether to do more science; to design a product, process, or medical treatment; to develop a new technology; or to predict the impacts of human actions.""The simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools.

You saw the vid, right? They were pretty obvious on the left. Also, stop calling left-winged people ""leftists"". It's dehumanizing. Just as I won't call you alt-right or Nazis or whatever, you should extend that  bit of decency.

Sooo... maybe he shouldnt've driven  his car into an active, violent rally? That would've not caused his car to be vandalized, and not cause him to have the wholly appropriate response of intentionally killing someone in return.

All of those things you listed are circumstances, and background. He still made the conscious decision to run over someone. Someone's child is dead, just because bozo didn't agree with her politically. Whether he's a terrorist or not is a matter of debate, noone can know whether he did it to attempt to further his political agenda. While I'm certain he did it because of his political beliefs (which is already enough to fit the bill of terrorism), im unsure whether he did it to further his political agenda.

And depending on how loose your definition of Nazi is, the confederate flag has been used by military units in all of ours, was on the Dukes of Hazard and was used by Lynyrd Skynrd (*Freebird, Sweet Home Alabama*), which is hardly Nazi or racist given that it was played at virtually every bar or bah'mitzvah I was invited to in New York.

Look, it's just that no one wants to live in a United States where communists are banning nazis. The only viable solution for our *own physical safety* is a balance of power, since leaning too hard to one extreme or the other is how you and your family end up in a death camp or a gulag.

Here is the only passage from my initial comment which discussed any sort of response to problematic speech. Please point to where I advocated for government censorship: ""At some point, it must become acceptable for us to say that certain people, certain groups, certain entities have proven to us that they cannot be trusted to use their freedom of speech in a responsible way. We must be able to place that which is toxic and has no socially redeeming value outside the bounds of what is acceptable. I don't know if we have to do that in a way that involves the law, but we must have some way of doing it.""

See, to me, that looks an awful lot like I'm advocating for *society* to act on its own behalf. To shun toxic ideas and disinformation and those who peddle them. Maybe it only looks that way to me because I'm capable of both reading and writing complex and nuanced ideas, but I think it's pretty clear.

They have that right, and even though it causes major issue within our society it's also what keeps freedom of speech viable.

The price of freedom is personal responsibility, if someone doesn't educate themselves against lies and deciet then they only have themselves to blame.

You are. Maybe not you individually right now at this moment, but have you checked in on your subreddit today? Or, you know, ever? Have you watched your news channel? Have you listened to your talk radio shows? I know you have, because you mentioned it in this comment. I watched the way your kind spent eight years talking about everyone to the left of Genghis Khan. I grew up among your kind. I know how you talk about people like me, because you've never been shy about doing it right to my face. Please don't pretend otherwise.

>It's a basic human empathy thing.

I empathize with the suffering of any working person, and work every day of my life to build a society that is not constructed around grinding people up until they die. I do not need to have a scintilla of affection or respect for people who believe demonstrably wrong shit in order to work towards a better world for them to live in.

>You have things that you like. You wouldn't want anyone to ban them. But other people like different things. You shouldn't try to ban things you don't like either.

You continue to misunderstand my argument. Part of me thinks it's willful, but part of me thinks you, and other conservatives, really can't get your heads around it. My position has nothing to do with what I ""don't like."" This has never been about ""offensiveness."" People on the left have always been willing to offend, and they remain willing to offend. This is about recognizing that actions, including speech, have consequences. No right can be absolute, because an absolute right necessarily provides for trampling someone else's rights.

I'm sure the sovereign citizen idiots didn't *intend* for their speech to directly incite someone to blow up an office building in Oklahoma City, killing hundreds of people including small children. If they wanted someone to do that, if they believed that doing that would be a force for social good, they'd have done it themselves. But how could it *not* have led to the bombing of the Murrah building? How could anti-abortion rhetoric *not* convince some small number of people to kill doctors in their churches and homes? How could racial dogwhistling for decades *not* ultimately lead to Donald Trump running and winning on a platform of open racial grievance?

>For most of our existence, the First Amendment wasn't just a suggestion, it was an ideal.

No it wasn't. It wasn't an ideal for the local governments that sanctioned the murder of civil rights activists all over America. It wasn't an ideal for the officials who sicced the police and the Pinkertons on union organizers. Free speech has only ever been an aspiration in this country. It has only ever applied to part of the country, never to all of it.

8049,"**Holodomor**

The Holodomor (Ukrainian: Голодомо́р); (derived from морити голодом, ""to kill by starvation"") was a man-made famine in Soviet Ukraine in 1932 and 1933 that killed millions of Ukrainians. It is also known as the Terror-Famine and Famine-Genocide in Ukraine, and sometimes referred to as the Great Famine or The Ukrainian Genocide of 1932–33. It was part of the wider Soviet famine of 1932–33, which affected the major grain-producing areas of the country. During the Holodomor, millions of inhabitants of Ukraine, the majority of whom were ethnic Ukrainians, died of starvation in a peacetime catastrophe unprecedented in the history of Ukraine.

>Why are you people lying?

I'm not 'any people'. I'm not right-wing or left-wing or anything else; I can recognise the flaws in political radicalism without the baggage of having to make sure 'my side' comes out as well as possible.

>If communism is really that bad, you should be able to argue against it without obvious lies?

Communism really *is* that bad. Although Capitalism is without a doubt a deeply flawed system, as it is guaranteed to result in widespread inequality of income (and, consequently, some people having a poor quality of life), it is - from the systems of government we have conceptualised - the best possible one. Communism may be a noble *ideal*, but the genocide it practically necessitates makes it a non-starter.

You know that's not entirely true. Police are corrupt, the deep state is untouchable. the NSA is illegal but it's still a thing. law makers drag their feet to do what we want but take fat checks from companies. ect ect. 

The keys of power are spread out, but there are a lot of power structures that will fight you or help stream line your political career.

You're advocating for social censorship. Right?

Take everything I'm saying and apply it to any social structure with a political interest, or the inherent self interests that come with a consolidation of power.

Fifth, you don't get to trot out the idea of ""free expression"" and white-knight all over this discussion because that's not even what it's about. Reddit, unlike your imagined Libertarian fantasy world, has site-wide rules.  Such as those concerning targeted harassment, doxxing, and real world threats. These quarantined subs have repeatedly violated any/all of these rules and the mods did nothing to reign it in (because they almost certainly support it). So Reddit issues them warnings that they have to stop breaking rules, otherwise they will take action against the community. So stop acting like you either 1) understand what this quarantine move was about or 2) actually give two shits about free speech just to try to take the moral high ground. You fool nobody. You're just upset because your favorite radical batshit-crazy sub is just one more click away and demonetized. If you want a safe space to be an ideological extremist, then go make one for yourself.

Conservatives in general hang their hats on that, in fact. ""Some of my best friends are black,"" don't you know. But it actually doesn't really matter, on the grand scale, if you're nice to the extremely small group of people who exist in your personal bubble.

No. They are as capable of receiving an education as anyone else. The American right wing has worked very hard to deny them an education, but they are quite capable of learning. They are human beings. As a rule, we're good at learning.

> So now you're actually saying repeal the First Amendment?  

No. I'm saying the First Amendment has been understood to have limits for a really long time. ""Yelling 'fire' in a crowded theater"" is not something I made up; it's from a Supreme Court decision outlining the necessary limits of free speech.

8302,"See, that's not really what a safe space is. ""Safe space,"" like ""trigger warning,"" is a concept that conservatives know just enough about to decide they hate it and it's an attack on them.

These ideas are in fact grounded in well-established science around trauma. When someone has experienced a trauma, they can experience real and serious psychological harm from having those memories triggered without warning. This can happen with any trauma. War veterans famously can be triggered by sounds or sights or other sensations that psychologically put them back in combat. Rape survivors can be triggered in similar ways. Any survivor of any trauma is at risk of this, and it can do real damage.

The ""safe space"" is designed to be a place where a trauma survivor can let their guard down and be sure that triggers have been removed. It is frequently an integral component in coming to terms with a traumatic experience.

A ""trigger warning,"" on the other hand, is what you do when you are *not* in a safe space. When you know you cannot create a safe space, but still want to be compassionate towards trauma sufferers. So, for instance, a college professor might issue, before beginning a discussion of *To Kill A Mockingbird*, a trigger warning for sexual violence and racial violence.

That's it. That's all they are. The concept of the ""safe space,"" *by its very definition*, rules out the idea that anyone could seriously propose turning ""all of planet Earth"" into a safe space. Safe spaces and trigger warnings, like political correctness, are attempts at creating a more compassionate society, a society of people who make small but meaningful efforts to not ruin someone else's day.

8322,"> First off, you're the one who put words in my mouth. Nobody and nothing gives you the goddamn right. 

You saying exactly what you said gives me that right. I didn't invent an anti free-expression stance for you, YOU did that as you typed one out. Don't pretend for a second.

>Second of all, I love free expression. It gives me the right to call neo-Nazi and misogynist views scum and chastise those who propagate it. 

Demonstrably it doesn't since you're doing so on a platform which you yourself admitted is under no obligation to provide free expression, and which you have praised for curtailing it. You even made a snarky quip about how the types of speech you don't like should literally be segregated away from public discourse.

>Third, I did mention constitutionality before you decided to grace this thread with your presence, so you arguing that I wasn't referring to that is idiotic at best. 

But u/GAMER_GIRL_POO didn't mention constitutionality, did they? They mentioned that you support limiting free expression, and you segued into constitutionality in the form of a non-sequitur. You mentioned it only to defer away from the accusation, which you then bolstered through the rest of your comment.  
So when someone accused you of celebrating limiting others free expression, your response amounted to ""Yes I do, but I'm allowed to"". Which doesn't refute anything they said.

>Fourth, Reddit can ban whatever the fuck they want to ban

Which is again, a total non-sequitur. Yes, they can. They can also shut the site down tomorrow or turn it into a furry porn forum. That's entirely irrelevant discussion. ""They shouldn't do X"" is not countered when you say ""They CAN do X"". ""Can"" and ""Should"" are different things. Did you not know this?

>Fifth, you don't get to trot out the idea of ""free expression"" and white-knight all over this discussion because that's not even what it's about.

Sure as fuck seems like it, given that curtailing free expression is the entire issue with this course of action, and the ideals of free expression are what Reddit was founded on.

>Reddit, unlike your imagined Libertarian fantasy world, has site-wide rules. Such as those concerning targeted harassment, doxxing, and real world threats. These quarantined subs have repeatedly violated any/all of these rules and the mods did nothing to reign it in (because they almost certainly support it).

Correct.  
The issue then becomes that these rules are selectively enforced. Where is r/inceltears , since they engage in harassment and doxxing as an integral part of the sub's existence? I notice r/fragilejewishredditor is on there, so where is r/fragilewhiteredditor ? r/FULLCOMMUNISM is up there for calls to violence, but it seems when r/latestagecapitalism makes posts calling for revolution and to kill the rich, that's fair game?  
Stop acting like this is purely rule-enforcement. We all know it's a partisan purge, and you pretending otherwise only highlights your support of such an action whilst knowing the optics are bad.

>So Reddit issues them warnings that they have to stop breaking rules, otherwise they will take action against the community

That's funny, because r/cringeanarchy did exactly that: Removed rule-breaking content. They were warned, took action to appease the site admins, and then were quarantined anyway. Sounds like a bit of a virtual Kristallnacht to me.

>So stop acting like you either 1) understand what this quarantine move was about

I understand what it's about just fine, it's the prelude to an outright ban for subs that aren't advertiser friendly due to their political leanings. It's why subs which ideologically oppose the quarantined ones but don't differ in intent or actions remain active, because it's fine for you to make fun of the ""acceptable"" targets like white people or the rich, but it's not okay to do the same for Jewish or homosexual individuals.  
Why pretend this is anything other than a partisan purge? We know which subs got quarantined and which didn't, so don't give me this ""it's just the rules"" shit.

>or 2) actually give two shits about free speech just to try to take the moral high ground.

I mean when did I call for any sub to be banned? When did I celebrate anything being banned or removed? Your projection is palpable, claiming that ""you don't support free speech, you just want to spew your hate!"" you scream while doing the same yourself. It'd be hilarious if it wasn't so sad.

>You're just upset because your favorite radical batshit-crazy sub is just one more click away and demonetized.

But I thought The_Donald was the ultimate radical sub, and they're still here!  
Does that upset you? Doesn't it hurt to have just claimed that admins are applying rules, in the same thread which began because a user called out the admins on not affecting a sub which ""routinely breaks the rules""? Does this hypocrisy know no end to you, or are you fully aware of it but honorbound to play along?

>If you want a safe space to be an ideological extremist, then go make one for yourself

Fair call. Lucky for me, the far-right is currently in the process of making ""reality"" that extremist safe-space. So I guess I can take some solace in that.

>Since you use Reddit, you play by their rules. And if you deem that ""unfair"", then I won't even waste my breath trying to explain the concept of ""fairness"" to you. 

As I said in my very first comment: ""Limiting others free expression is okay if daddy corporation tells me it is!""

You don't need to lie about what your movement is if it can hold water by itself; if Feminism is Feminism (Female Rights, as demonstrated during Suffrage) then it can't claim to be Humanitarianism, its roots are already too deepset in history (a history that rejected true equality in favor of more gyno-centric perks).

Humanity needs Humanitarians, not Feminists. It just comes across as WOMEN fighting AGAINST MEN/THE WORLD for all rights, which is what it started out as. You can't change the definition of something just because pretending to be inclusive brings in more money, if you change the definition (the goals) then you change what it's called.

But it feels that way. You're suggesting that it's automatically BAD propaganda simply because it's non-American. That there's anything wrong with this viewpoint simply because it's not American. Like I said, none of it is pro-Russian. 

>We're talking about influencing campaigns managed and organized by a foreign state.

Like I said - it depends on how much influence you think they had, in a sub that was already 100% voting for Trump, to make people want to vote for Trump. 

> So why bring it up? Was I supposed to be incapable of criticizing my preferred politician? That's a trait much more commonly found in The_Donald.

The point being is that surely that link is evidence of ""Russian collusion"" by Obama, but for some reason some Russian guys making pro-Trump posts on Reddit is really bad? In any case remember I'm banned from that sub - I don't agree with everything they do either. However, I don't think that banning the entire sub is any kind of reasonable solution.

You don't really know what the left is, do you?

We just had the foresight of being smart enough to use protection when we were kids, not get knocked up, and had the time to realize children rearing sucks. 

 If you want a basic miserable life, cool bruh.  But why do you want kids while destroying the planet and setting your hopeful fuck trophies up in the shit society you're inevitably working towards?  Aren't parents supposed to want the best for their kids?  I hope you don't want a daughter.  Yeesh.  Your children are absolutely going to hate and resent you and the life you gave them.

However these lines have been blurred for years and it isn't necessarily a bad thing.  Some publishers play the role of platform with things like editorials, blog posts and comments.  Platforms of course edit and curate some content as they find it necessary as we are discussing here.


So of course the problem is why do they curate content?  At the end of the day they have their core userbase, a corporate image to maintain and of course financial responsibilities.  Since the majority of revenue is ad based they have no choice but to listen to advertisers.  Is it an issue that these platforms don't allow pornography?  It's no different than with Alex Jones.  I mean, if youporn or something could push sample content on Facebook I imagine it would generate a ton of extra clicks for them.  Nobody seems sad they're relegated to their own infrastructure.  You need to work with specific advertisers to make money off porn, your mainstream advertisers won't be interested at all anymore once porn is involved.  Pretty simple stuff.


As for why Alex Jones was banned around the same time?  Hard to say, my best guess is it came down to a large umbrella corporation that owns many different advertisers that utilize the platforms had an issue with his recent Sandy Hook nonsense.  They threatened to pull ads from all platforms supporting him, thus it looks like they all conspired to ban him.  If we're looking for the simplest most common sense reasoning that requires no mental gymnastics that would be it.  The problem is people who like Alex Jones don't think that way so to them he must have been banned for being too close to the truth or upset the deep state or some nonsense.",1,e6z4fnm,PrincessMelody2002,<praw.models.comment_forest.CommentForest object at 0x7f8df283a590>,t1_e6t3owm,1538411260

Every study of the 2015-2016 media coverage of the election I've seen indicates that they spent an inordinate amount of time focusing on her emails and Benghazi, which I'm sure to you mean ""Hillary's lies."" Hillary started the campaign out polling basically even on favorability; she ended it as the second-most unpopular major-party Presidential nominee since the advent of polling. Nothing about her as a person changed; the way the media covered her certainly did.

Take a look at how their respective fave/unfave ratings chart over the course of the race. [For Trump](https://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/donald-trump-favorable-rating), he started out at 20% favorable, 67% unfavorable, but the day before the election, he was at 40% favorable, 57% unfavorable. His favorable rating had doubled and his unfavorable rating had gone down by 10 points. Again, as with Hillary, little to nothing about the man himself had changed; but the media coverage had a clear and positive impact.

Meanwhile, let's take Hillary's numbers at the same starting point: June of 2015. At that time, she was at 46% favorable, 48% unfavorable. Already, media coverage of her was taking a toll. The [chart here](http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/pollster/hillary-clinton-favorable-rating) is very instructive. Her numbers start taking a dive almost immediately after Obama's re-election; that coincides with when coverage of her shifted from ""Secretary of State Hillary Clinton"" to ""prospective Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton."" It also coincides with when coverage of Benghazi started. By the time of the election, her numbers were 34% favorable, 54% unfavorable--farther underwater than Trump, with a lower favorable rating and almost the same unfavorable rating.

So when I look at a campaign in which one candidate started out 47 points underwater and ended up 17 points underwater, and another candidate started out two points underwater and ended up 20 points underwater, it sure looks to me like the media coverage was relatively friendly to the first candidate and relatively unfriendly to the second.

> They believe they are suffering from systemic violence and racism, by the state. They don't use the exact words, but that's basically ""police are targeting us."" There's a reason most of their news coverage comes from protests of cops shooting black people - because that's by and large when they're most active. It's their raison d'etre. 

You've come so close to grasping their concern, and yet somehow it eludes you. The operative word in that first sentence is *systemic*. Systemic racism does not require every individual cop to be ""out to shoot every black person they see."" It does not even require *any* individual cop to be out to shoot every black person they see. The objections of BLM to the state of law enforcement in this country are not about whether all, most, or even a lot of police officers are active, overt, conscious racists with a thirst for blood. The objections are to a system which has been set up to put black people at an extreme disadvantage, to police them and punish them at disproportionate rates, to vilify them to such an extent that police officers are conditioned to fear for their lives upon seeing a black person, and to instill a complete lack of accountability in police departments. Those are grievances aimed at systems, not individuals; the movement is not built upon calling all cops murderers.

8698,"> Because that got them views. In any case, just covering his rallies isn't implicit support 

Their motivations are not at issue here. They aired his rallies uninterrupted and without commentary; that's not something that any candidate for any office gets in this day and age. Also not at issue is whether they were ""supporting"" him. What is at issue is that they were not trying to do a hatchet job on him. They treated him as a serious candidate long before they actually believed he was a serious candidate. Contrast their treatment of him with their treatment of Bernie; not a lot of coverage until he won New Hampshire. And--as a former field staffer for his campaign--I thought that was appropriate. An insurgent/longshot candidate does have to earn coverage. Otherwise the media would have to treat Vermin Supreme as a legitimate candidate. But Trump didn't have to earn it. He got it right from the start.

> it would probably have been a disservice to do the same for Hillary since she had nowhere near the energy Trump does, she could never draw the same kinds of crowds. 

Reasonable people can disagree on this point, but I don't think the crowds were the reason those rallies had an impact. It was that his ideas--many of which were until recently considered either disgusting or stupid by the mainstream of American society, not just ""elites""--were given the imprimatur of the establishment political media. If CNN is putting this guy on the air, that must mean he's not a wackjob, therefore his ideas must be within the scope of acceptable discussion, therefore I should listen to them with an open mind.

> Did it? Can you prove the media coverage was responsible for that change in a significant way? 

It's not the only factor, and I'm open to being proven wrong, but what other factors are there? Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton didn't change over the course of those 16 months. Their beliefs didn't change. Their platforms changed only marginally, if at all.

What did change? The coverage around Hillary Clinton began to center on themes of corruption, her being out of touch, Benghazi, her emails, etc. The coverage around Donald Trump was also generally negative, but always interspersed with breathless stories about HOW IS HE DOING THIS???? POLITICAL SAVANT??? and his supposed skill at communicating with the working class (most of which didn't actually vote for him in the end.) In simplified terms, Hillary was cast as the out of touch Washington insider, and Trump was cast as the bull in a china shop who wasn't afraid to break things. One of those narratives paints a clearly negative picture; the other is one that plenty of people in America could get behind.

And even if you think both of those narratives are true, and that the media was just calling balls and strikes, the question, going back a few comments upthread, is whether CNN has been attacking Trump from the word go, and whether or not their objection to him is ideological. And I think the evidence suggests that the answer to both is no.

> His approval rating [hasn't exactly been tanking](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/other/trump_favorableunfavorable-5493.html) since the MSM put a target on his back, either.  

Probably because their attacks are informed by centrism, and no one in America is centrist! The loudest anti-Trump voices are the ones with the least to say about how he has impacted this country.

> Perhaps his rating has very little to do with how the media portrays him, because he constantly tells his supporters they're 'fake news'. 

In this day and age, it is probably almost impossible for a sitting President to have an approval rating below 35, yes. But by that same token, he should be able to reach the mid-60s before he runs into the opposite end of diminishing returns. Something is affecting those ratings.

1) Just because you only notice their protests when they occur in proximity to a cop killing an unarmed black person doesn't mean that's the only time they protest.
